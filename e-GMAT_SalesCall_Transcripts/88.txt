7:29
Hello, hello, hey .

7:37
Yes, yeah.

7:39
So you know the call has been pushing since couple of days so finally happened so with this call.

7:49
So this call is majorly for clearing whatever queries you have, you know, just to give you complete clarity of whatever you would like to understand.

8:00
No, I have gone through the, I have gone through few CR videos which were free of free.

8:09
Yeah, yeah, I have gone through them.

8:11
And also I think that session was pushed because of those mock.

8:17
I was unable to even find a suitable time and able to connect.

8:21
So I gave the mock yesterday.

8:23
I think I have gone through the video also that about what is provided in the course and I am and I think I can put in weekly few hours for this prep and mainly how many hours how you are planning, how many hours on a weekly basis, how you are planning?

8:44
I can put 21 to 22 hours I think good enough good enough good enough good enough.

8:52
So I think I can manage with that.

8:54
And from yesterdays mock I think which would be very similar to what the actual exam would be.

9:02
I think I need to be I need to practice more on verbal and quads, verbal and data insights.

9:10
Sorry, Sir, verbal and data insights quads I think I was not able to do mostly because I have forgotten most of the concepts I just can review and I can do.

9:23
But actually I will planning.

9:25
I think I have, I think I have shared with you that I am planning to give GMAT because I am interested for the one year programs in the Iams that will happen from the applications for which will open from April I think, right, It will be opening from April.

9:42
Yeah, you would have deadline for a couple of months.

9:45
Yeah, till October I think.

9:47
I think I will have the deadline, yeah, yeah.

9:52
So just have to the official announcement yet to come on the deadline.

9:57
Yeah.

9:57
So once once it comes, you can just check, check the route as well.

10:02
Anyway if regarding what colleges I can apply with this course or what are the colleges, what are the application forms that were coming and I should apply Is there will the yeah, just looking for only India, right.

10:15
Only India right?

10:17
For now I have plans only in India.

10:21
I have not heard any of the quotes that will be NCR.

10:24
Singapore would be a good choice for you apart from India if you are looking.

10:29
NCR does say with the highest cost so you know.

10:32
I have sent you a couple of videos.

10:33
You remember this 210 improvement and 675675700 plus also.

10:41
So you know with with A685695 score you can apply for INSEAD also INSEAD is among the top 10 schools across the globe and Singapore.

10:52
It is in Singapore.

10:53
So really good return on investment.

10:56
Lot of scholarship options.

10:58
ISVISB may sound like a very hefty fees and all these things but it is going to be cheaper than I, I, Ms if you have a really good gmatch score because ISV gives up to 100% scholarship in round one application.

11:13
So there are multiple rounds of application that happens in this top schools.

11:17
So we have to look for round one where they will be.

11:20
So as the round progress Round 2 and round 3 they will be more choosy and the the scholarship will also be lesser.

11:26
But round one gives up to the round one application.

11:30
Deadlines are mostly till when the 15th September around around 15th September plus or -5 days most of the schools even inside also around mid of September is when most schools have the round one deadline.

11:46
The round one was before one year MBA timber, the application round one deadline.

11:51
The round one deadlines are around September for all major items mid of September.

11:56
OK, OK, so I am not I am you have to check particularly they they just sometimes they just go one month up and down and up and down.

12:03
So you just have to check based on the outcome.

12:06
But the ISBNCR, all the schools with the standard process no, since years for them it is it is going to be at that time only.

12:14
So it has been since years they have changed.

12:16
So you don't expect this year.

12:18
Also the deadline is going to be the same around mid of September.

12:23
If would be better if I plan to give my exam in the month of July only, it would be July only.

12:31
July, June, July you have to give some ample time so that because you have prep you are going to give 20 hours of study to take time till June, July to completely get done with the whole element and to get to that particular high score.

12:45
We are not settling for.

12:46
See the median score for ISBI Ms and all are 655665 which is a 92% and 93%.

12:56
We shouldn't settle for that.

12:57
We should look for pushing it to a 98 kind of percentile, 9798 percentile.

13:03
So 695 kind of a score 685695 is something which we need to push ourselves because right now you have the advantage of time.

13:12
You are not thankfully you are not in the month of April or May sitting and talking to me or we are discussing about the prep right now.

13:19
You are, you are at least way ahead of a lot of students who decide later on.

13:24
So that is the advantage that you have got and you can, you need not push for 30 hours, 40 hours right now because that is not required.

13:31
But if you have someone who is at this capability and that end of April or something, you would have to push it way harder like 35 hours of prep time per week to eventually even think of getting there.

13:46
Yeah.

13:47
So I if I take the 4 months, 4 months course is that will be enough for this?

13:57
The rate I am the current score which I have got 4 months is good enough.

14:05
Provided every week you are consistently giving in that particular study time and you are very consistent without a break of even a week because it will be a close space.

14:14
But suppose if you want to suppose in the 4 months of time you are already at a So now it is starting so March, April, May and June.

14:23
So that will be June.

14:24
If you want to extend it for one more month later on, you can do an extension at a nominal cost of $89.

14:30
It will be around ?7000 kind of for one month extension.

14:34
At that point of time, if required, you can do that.

14:37
OK yeah.

14:39
So I don't think if I take the 6 months course I have enough time to at least prep for that because I am planning because because it will be end of July then August because I am planning.

15:01
I I just lost you.

15:03
Your your voice.

15:04
Just Hello Adesha.

15:19
Hello.

15:27
If I am audible.

15:29
Yeah, Yeah.

15:29
Now you are.

15:29
Now you are audible.

15:30
Yes, yes, you audible.

15:32
OK, so you are asking something I think I was asking that only that 4I would like to go for the 4 months course only because 6 months would stretch a long time.

15:45
I&I don't think I don't have enough time to prep for 6 months and then we give the exam, correct?

15:52
Correct.

15:53
4 months is the suitable option for you, $99 right?

16:02
One month is $99 like $89 after extension.

16:09
4 months is 4 months course is you know priced at 2:00, $99 which is around 25,500 for 4 months.

16:20
That's the pricing yeah yeah, I got it, I got it.

16:25
I will I will go for the 4 months only and if required then I will just extend it for one month.

16:31
The one thing that was not mentioned in the video I think the mock test thing.

16:38
Can you please just brief me once because I don't think the mocks thing is properly explained.

16:45
I have seen the video can you just so I will I will show you as well.

16:50
So you will have 5 full length adaptive test which is you know computer adaptive test.

16:54
You are going to have 5 full length apart from that you are going to have 90 plus sectional mocks.

17:00
You are going to find around 60 plus from our portal itself and you are going to have around you know 40 from GMAT.

17:08
So you know that is for your extra practice.

17:11
We are it is a $70 worth of you know GMAT club, you know sectional test which we are purchasing and giving you for free of cost along with the course so that you don't need to go anywhere beyond for anything.

17:23
So you get everything in a single place.

17:25
So that's why we are doing that.

17:28
So apart from that access to GMAT, GMAT Club will be there to me for the 4 months GMAT that will be for 3 months that access is there for 3 months the because that is not provided by us.

17:43
We are purchasing and giving it to you that is like so that is something which we purchase and give it to you.

17:48
So maybe you can you know so you can activate it, you can reach out to the support team they will activate it for you and then it will be valid for 3 months so you can utilise it.

17:57
So here is where you would find cementing question which is like sub sectional mock.

18:01
It is not just sectional that we have.

18:02
We also have sub sectional mocks just for CR, just for RC.

18:06
If you look at quant you further bifurcate arithmetic into number of properties, what problems advanced topic for the detailed analysis and then data insights again you would have sub sectional mark if you if you just see they will have topic wise MSRGITATPA data sufficiency.

18:22
And then you have sectional which is suppose if you take verbal you are going to have sectional mocks.

18:28
So this is the sectional mocks that you would have section on section.

18:31
So the first sectional mock is not adaptive it is called condensed sectional mark for improving your accuracy and here you will have normal sectional mark which is adapted.

18:39
So we are the only platform which gives adaptive sectional mark.

18:43
Like if you take a sectional mark here you are going to have like the exact replica of your vowel section 45 minutes adaptive you are going to attempt and you would see that what is your score.

18:53
So that is a very big advantage that you are going to have.

18:56
And then once that is done the same way for cons and data and sets also, you are going to have the sectional marks accordingly.

19:01
You would find here which is the section mark count, right?

19:04
So you are going to have a high volume of sectional box.

19:08
And apart from that you are also going to have you know custom quizzes.

19:12
So what is the significance of custom quizzes?

19:15
So you can do targeted learning within CR.

19:17
So we go to that level where within CR you can actually create custom quiz just for inference, just for evaluate, just for this particular topics also.

19:26
And another advantage of this custom quizzes is towards the last end of your prep, you can actually create a whole question bank out of all the incorrect questions from day one till the end.

19:36
It will be catalogued and you can create a whole question Bank of incorrect questions which would be a very high value question pool for you.

19:43
And that too topic wise you can get.

19:46
So that is a big advantage.

19:47
And then you know a lot of analytics that you get you would be a bit overwhelmed by it, but the idea is you would have a dedicated mentor who would be guiding you through year prep.

19:58
So yes, exactly this was this was a lot of information that you gave me and I think I have grasped only a few about the different types of test and what I need to do.

20:08
I think I don't have to be worried.

20:10
Yeah, I think once if I involve you would be able to guide me better regarding what to give first and how to proceed.

20:20
Yeah.

20:21
And you don't see the.

20:23
So we have mentorship in 2 phases that is.

20:26
Phase one till you reach a 615 and Phase 2 is last mile push program which you would be enrolled free of cost.

20:33
That is by default part of the program where you would be getting one on one live session like teams call.

20:39
We would be correcting but before that all the communication till you reach that capability it will be through email and chat support.

20:46
This is like the Facebook Messenger like whenever you your mentor pings you would get a pop up.

20:50
When you ping them they get a pop up.

20:51
You don't have to take the headache of sending a mail and all the things you are going to get it here itself.

20:57
And another advantage is whatever you communicate here, you are going to get a copy of it in your WhatsApp also like not in the WhatsApp the email as well the same whatever communication you have here, you are going to have a copy of it in your email so that that will be documented for you.

21:13
OK, OK.

21:15
I think once I the mentorship program in the first phase, how frequent it is to guide me how, how should I proceed with the completion of you don't have any.

21:25
So from day one your mentor would be assigned.

21:27
Suppose if you are taking the course today, within 24 hours, a mentor would be assigned to you.

21:32
And once a mentor is assigned, they are going to give you set of tasks that you have to do.

21:36
You are going to do those tasks based on their instruction and guidance.

21:40
You are going to do that.

21:42
Once you are done with that, they would evaluate you and they, they would say that give you a feedback and then you are going to do the next set of task which they give.

21:49
So it will be a task based approach that you will be going through.

21:51
Of course you are going to have you are going to create a study plan.

21:54
So the moment you enroll, you will see a set of onboarding videos and guide guiding videos with which we would be creating this study plan on an everyday what has to be done.

22:03
You would get a clarity, but this is skeleton.

22:05
The flesh on the skin is going to be your mentor who who build that on on top of your prep.

22:11
So you are going to have a very clear clarity.

22:12
How many hours of verbal prep is required?

22:14
How many hours of corn prep?

22:15
How many hours of you know, data inside prep?

22:19
And when you say that you would be finished, you would get a complete clarity accordingly.

22:22
You can accelerate, decelerate your prep, all this things would happen.

22:27
Yeah, I got OK.

22:29
Yeah, I got it.

22:32
I got it.

22:33
I will do that.

22:35
So, yeah.

22:36
So this is our, you know, GMAT club within GMAT club, you know, if you just look at our reviews, you would find and and I have just put the filter for the last mail push program.

22:46
So in the last mail push you would see, you know, all the people talking about how the last mail push has been helpful and you would also be part of it, but not the starting itself.

22:53
But of course, once you reach that particular level, it see how the last time push program help.

22:58
So you just read this.

22:59
I especially love the Olympic program where they provide you a mentor and personalise that it's at no extra cost.

23:04
So you know that that is something which is there and condition is you are already at a good level.

23:09
The good level is around A615625 score.

23:12
So so you know how it helps.

23:14
So that that is that is the whole thing.

23:16
Almost everybody the in the video, what did it see?

23:19
Everyone is part of last minute push by default that is part of the course offering.

23:23
OK, Yeah, OK.

23:26
I will just I think I will enroll for this program because I have already pushed it a lot.

23:34
Yeah, I will enroll for this program in by today or by tomorrow only and I will start my prep as soon as possible.

23:43
Since you decided to start by today or tomorrow.

23:47
I, I, I, I would like to say that we also have some discounts running on the price which you can avail since it will be there for only for a limited time.

23:54
So since you have already decided to purchase with tomorrow, so I, we generally don't push people to purchase with the discount.

24:00
So since you have decided for that, I, I help you with that discount coupon as well for, for, for the purchase.

24:07
So basically it is a $299 the course for 4 months you would get a $50 off.

24:14
So you are going to get it for a 249.

24:16
So yeah.

24:18
So so you can avail that and purchase before anytime midnight before before midnight tomorrow you can use that link for the purchase.

24:27
So from where do I purchase from direct the website.

24:30

24:34
The coupon, I will say I will send you the coupon in the chat box here in the Teams chat.

24:41

25:28
And the moment you make the purchase, just give me a message because your account would be automatically activated.

25:34
So that is not a trouble.

25:36
But the mental assignment is a manual process which we have to initiate.

25:39
So you know, the sooner the better.

25:42
So I once you once I buy the course, I will ping you in WhatsApp regarding the payment details so that you can you don't have to send me any screen you don't have to send me anything.
