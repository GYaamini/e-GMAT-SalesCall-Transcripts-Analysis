0:02
What are you doing with respect to the Gmap preparation?
Speaker: agent

0:04
Have you started it?
Speaker: agent

0:05
Is this your first time?
Speaker: agent

0:06
And what's the plan?
Speaker: agent

0:07
If you can give me a little bit idea.
Speaker: agent

0:10
It's my first time I've I've taken this decision very recently to write Gmap like maybe a one week or two weeks ago.
Speaker: prospect

0:21
So got it.
Speaker: agent

0:23
So I have just gone through few walks, I mean not answered them just the PDF kind of things and just looked at them.
Speaker: prospect

0:34
So just understand the pattern and everything.
Speaker: prospect

0:36
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:37
That's it.
Speaker: prospect

0:38
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:39
So what what is the main goal?
Speaker: agent

0:42
Which B schools do you want to go to and when do you want to start your MBA program?
Speaker: agent

0:47
What's the goal there?
Speaker: agent

0:51
I want to go to ISB.
Speaker: prospect

0:53
OK, ISP.
Speaker: agent

0:56
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:58
The full time, the two year MBA, the the full time normal PGP program.
Speaker: prospect

1:02
Is that the goal?
Speaker: agent

1:04
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

1:05
PGPYLPGPYL.
Speaker: prospect

1:08
So right now you're in your 4th year or what's the current status?
Speaker: agent

1:14
I've been working.
Speaker: prospect

1:15
It's been 10 months.
Speaker: prospect

1:17
Got it.
Speaker: agent

1:18
Maybe I should get ready in three months and then I should submit my application.
Speaker: prospect

1:25
I think I should get more about ISP procedure and everything.
Speaker: prospect

1:31
Understood.
Speaker: agent

1:32
So you're, you're saying you have the VILE deadline in April?
Speaker: agent

1:34
Is that what it is?
Speaker: agent

1:37
Application deadline?
Speaker: agent

1:38
Yeah, March or April, March or April and below.
Speaker: prospect

1:44
One year, work experience is below.
Speaker: prospect

1:46
2 years of work experience is something they are eligible for.
Speaker: agent

1:48
VILE, right?
Speaker: agent

1:49
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

1:50
Yeah, two years.
Speaker: prospect

1:51
We build less than two years.
Speaker: agent

1:52
More than two years.
Speaker: agent

1:53
It's the the normal PGP program.
Speaker: agent

1:55
OK, got it.
Speaker: agent

1:57
Understood.
Speaker: agent

1:57
So you'll have to wrap up the entire process in about 3 months or so.
Speaker: agent

2:03
Got it.
Speaker: agent

2:03
I just want to double check this one ISBYL application deadlines.
Speaker: agent

2:11
That way we'll have a proper timeline.
Speaker: agent

2:15
Yeah, March 16th, that's the deadline.
Speaker: agent

2:19
I'm sharing the screen.
Speaker: agent

2:22
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

2:24
Can you see the screen?
Speaker: agent

2:27
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

2:27
At LE Career Professional, zero to 24.
Speaker: agent

2:29
It's a 20 month program, application deadline March 16th, Round 2.
Speaker: agent

2:35
So by March 16th you'll have to take the GMAT, work on the application draft and completely do the submission as well.
Speaker: agent

2:41
That's the last date.
Speaker: agent

2:42
So right now, forget January is over, you have February and made of one.
Speaker: agent

2:48
1 1/2 month is there to do the entire thing currently as of now.
Speaker: agent

2:52
OK fine, got it.
Speaker: prospect

2:54
Understood.
Speaker: agent

2:54
And for this 1 1/2 month on a daily basis, practically speaking, how much time can, you know, take out just for studying for the GMAT and this other stuff?
Speaker: agent

3:06
Four to five hours because I have to go got it.
Speaker: prospect

3:10
Four to five hours.
Speaker: agent

3:11
Four to five hours is a lot of time for studying actually.
Speaker: agent

3:13
So that is good.
Speaker: agent

3:14
If you can take four to five hours, good enough.
Speaker: agent

3:17
One 1 1/2 month timeline every day, four to five hours, I believe Saturday and Sunday you can put in more time that is possible.
Speaker: agent

3:24
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

3:25
Then, then, then time investment is will not be a constraint for you.
Speaker: agent

3:30
You would have good amount.
Speaker: agent

3:32
You don't have the luxury of time because we have to wrap it up in 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

3:35
But 45 hours is actually good amount of time to achieve anything in in about 45 days.
Speaker: agent

3:40
So that that part is good.
Speaker: agent

3:42
It's just that how do we utilize the time?
Speaker: agent

3:44
Are we studying in the right format, right structure that we're following or not?
Speaker: agent

3:48
That's the deal.
Speaker: agent

3:48
That's going to be the deal breaker.
Speaker: agent

3:50
In your case, that would happen.
Speaker: agent

3:52
OK, All right, so this part is there.
Speaker: agent

3:54
Now I want to understand a couple of more things.
Speaker: agent

3:56
Do you have a GMAT score in mind right now, a target GMAT score in mind, 700 plus is what 700 plus is something that is required.
Speaker: agent

4:08
7:05 or higher than that is something which you need.
Speaker: agent

4:13
So how did you get to this target?
Speaker: agent

4:18
How somebody told you or no?
Speaker: agent

4:23
When I'm going through this ISP admission process, they said that it's 700 plus.
Speaker: prospect

4:28
It will be good if you get 700 plus, correct, correct, correct.
Speaker: prospect

4:33
So probably they are talking about the old GMAT 700 plus because that used to be an average score at ISB.
Speaker: agent

4:43
Now we have a new GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:45
The calculation and all is different.
Speaker: agent

4:47
On the old GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:48
A 700 score is equal to a 645 on the new GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:53
So that that that that hazard that is something which is there.
Speaker: agent

4:56
But regardless of that which for ISB, for YL program, because most early career candidates of play, they do threaten to submit a higher score because they are just fresh out of college.
Speaker: agent

5:09
It's easy for them to prepare for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

5:12
So they do generally submit a higher score.
Speaker: agent

5:14
So in your case, 7:05 or higher is definitely should aim for it 99th percentile.
Speaker: agent

5:21
But even if you get a 670, 5685 score a little bit lower, it's fine.
Speaker: agent

5:26
675 or higher than that 96th percentile or higher than that, that would be a good target for ISP for the while program.
Speaker: agent

5:33
So that part is there.
Speaker: agent

5:35
So yeah, you know, so 705 is your target if you get 20 points lower still OK, that that's what it it's going to be.
Speaker: agent

5:42
And right now you, you, I know you have looked at some old questions and tests, but how do you have full familiarity on the aspects of GMAT?
Speaker: agent

5:55
I mean, especially the questions.
Speaker: agent

5:56
Verbal is there within verbal, there are two types of things.
Speaker: agent

5:59
Critical reasoning, reading comprehension in quant arithmetic, algebra, in data insights, 4 type of questions are there that familiarity exists as of now or no?
Speaker: agent

6:09
Yeah, that exists.
Speaker: prospect

6:11
Critical, critical reasoning is separate or reading comprehension is separate.
Speaker: prospect

6:14
You're, you're familiar with that.
Speaker: prospect

6:17
OK, that is very good, that works.
Speaker: agent

6:20
And so obviously you'll have to start the preparation right away.
Speaker: agent

6:24
Like tomorrow onwards, you'll have to start the preparation.
Speaker: agent

6:27
There is no one day.
Speaker: agent

6:30
Two days is also a huge amount of time in, in your case, because the deadline is in about 1 1/2 month for sure we have to start right away.
Speaker: agent

6:39
So you let me know exactly what do you want from this discussion.
Speaker: agent

6:43
I'll try to focus on in that direction.
Speaker: agent

6:45
What's the main goal?
Speaker: agent

6:46
What do you want from this discussion?
Speaker: agent

6:49
I just need the process to study.
Speaker: prospect

6:51
I mean, how will I get that score?
Speaker: prospect

6:55
I need a process like I couldn't work on them.
Speaker: prospect

6:59
It's not too difficult and too easy, but you got it.
Speaker: prospect

7:05
How exactly to structure the overall preparation, what to follow, what to do, what not to do in a, in, in the in the next one week, what to do next, another one week, what to do that overall clarity unit.
Speaker: agent

7:15
Definitely, we'll discuss all those aspects in a proper structured way.
Speaker: agent

7:18
We'll discuss that.
Speaker: agent

7:20
Couple of more questions with respect to resources for studying for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

7:25
Do you already have a course or are you looking for the EGMAT course to study the next in the next 45 days?
Speaker: agent

7:30
What is the plan there for the resources for the GMAT?
Speaker: agent

7:36
I have some books.
Speaker: prospect

7:38
I got them online.
Speaker: prospect

7:40
I mean, I just ordered them.
Speaker: prospect

7:42
I'll tell you the book means yeah.
Speaker: prospect

8:08
This GMAT official guide that kind of I've got GMAT GMAT official Guide, normal book, right?
Speaker: prospect

8:17
the IT has all the three sections, verbal, quant and data insights.
Speaker: prospect

8:21
Yeah, yeah, got it.
Speaker: agent

8:24
What else is there?
Speaker: agent

8:28
That is the only book you have.
Speaker: agent

8:29
OK, understood, got it.
Speaker: agent

8:31
So definitely you have to spend some time on that book.
Speaker: agent

8:35
That is an official book.
Speaker: agent

8:37
It's the most authentic resource out there that you have to do, but you cannot do it right away.
Speaker: agent

8:44
So the official guide is nothing but a set of previous GMAT questions, the old GMAT questions, it has a bunch of things.
Speaker: agent

8:52
Definitely you have to practice those questions.
Speaker: agent

8:54
That way you would know that you are ready for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

8:57
If you can solve those questions, obviously you can solve the GMAT kind of questions as well.
Speaker: agent

9:02
That is number one.
Speaker: agent

9:03
And of course there is a problem with that book.
Speaker: agent

9:05
It has more of easy questions.
Speaker: agent

9:06
It doesn't have a lot of hard level questions.
Speaker: agent

9:09
That's how it is.
Speaker: agent

9:10
That's that's what they do.
Speaker: agent

9:11
But yeah, unfortunately, but you have to do that.
Speaker: agent

9:14
But that's not a book to learning learn stuff.
Speaker: agent

9:19
Let's say for example, critical reasoning is there.
Speaker: agent

9:21
There are a bunch of concepts that you need to learn.
Speaker: agent

9:23
You need to learn the right methodology to solve critical reasoning questions.
Speaker: agent

9:27
Similarly, algebra is there, bunch of concepts are there, and you need to have the right methodology to solve very hard level questions.
Speaker: agent

9:33
A step by step method should be learned.
Speaker: agent

9:35
All those things.
Speaker: agent

9:36
You cannot do that from book.
Speaker: agent

9:37
That book is mainly for practice.
Speaker: agent

9:40
So in your specific case, because you're a beginner to the preparation, your sequence of preparation will be like this.
Speaker: agent

9:46
First you have to build a strong foundation #1 foundations and basics.
Speaker: agent

9:50
For on verbal quant, data insets, you'll have to fix.
Speaker: agent

9:53
Then you have to learn the concepts that are tested on the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

9:57
Then you have to learn the right method.
Speaker: agent

9:59
So you have foundation, you have conceptual and theoretical knowledge.
Speaker: agent

10:03
Now, when you see a critical reasoning question, what is the method to solve it?
Speaker: agent

10:08
When you see a algebra question, what is the method to solve it?
Speaker: agent

10:11
You have to learn those methods and then you have to practice a lot using those methods.
Speaker: agent

10:17
In that practice stage, that book will come in place.
Speaker: agent

10:21
But before that, there are bunch of things that need to happen.
Speaker: agent

10:24
If we do not do these bunch of things, if we directly jump into practice, it will be a disaster.
Speaker: agent

10:29
So I mean that, that that's what it is.
Speaker: agent

10:31
I'm, I'm trying to be very transparent and little bit brutal as well, but that's what it is.
Speaker: agent

10:36
So the book alone is not sufficient for sure.
Speaker: agent

10:39
And because you have to wrap up your Gmap preparation in 1 1/2 month, you have to go for a course.
Speaker: agent

10:45
For sure, EGMAD is the best course out there.
Speaker: agent

10:48
We have the we, we deliver the most number of success stories.
Speaker: agent

10:51
Definitely look, consider EGMAD, but do your research and choose any other course if you think that is the right fit for you.
Speaker: agent

10:57
No problem at all.
Speaker: agent

10:58
I'm not pushing EGMAD course here.
Speaker: agent

11:00
You do your research and choose another course as well.
Speaker: agent

11:02
But definitely you need a full-fledged course.
Speaker: agent

11:05
That book, you have to do that book, but somewhere in middle, not as the entire thing.
Speaker: agent

11:10
So that is a big thing here.
Speaker: agent

11:12
So what I will do right now is I'll take the next 15 minutes.
Speaker: agent

11:17
Let's discuss the exact strategy for the next 45 days, what needs to be done.
Speaker: agent

11:23
We'll understand the overall philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

11:26
I will also share my screen.
Speaker: agent

11:27
I'll show you the EG MAD course modules.
Speaker: agent

11:29
That way you understand if you're an EG MAD student, exactly how you can do the course.
Speaker: agent

11:34
So basically right now, let's assume that you're an EG MAD student.
Speaker: agent

11:37
Let's see how you would prepare for the next 45 days.
Speaker: agent

11:39
That way you'll have two things.
Speaker: agent

11:41
One is you'll understand the entire philosophy of how to study for the 45 days.
Speaker: agent

11:45
You will also see the AG Mat modules.
Speaker: agent

11:47
If you think the entire logic makes sense, you can obviously go with the AG Mat course so that that part is always there.
Speaker: agent

11:52
We will do that.
Speaker: agent

11:53
And during this discussion, if you have any questions, stop me at any point and ask a question.
Speaker: agent

11:58
OK, OK, that that will do.
Speaker: prospect

12:00
So I'm sharing the screen.
Speaker: agent

12:02
Let me know if you can see it.
Speaker: agent

12:04
Is this visible?
Speaker: agent

12:05
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

12:08
Oh, OK.
Speaker: agent

12:08
All right, so this is how your typical EG MAD course dashboard looks like.
Speaker: agent

12:12
One should log in as a student, bunch of learning modules, quizzing, platform, mock test, everything would be there.
Speaker: agent

12:19
But yeah, we'll, we'll not worry about all of them.
Speaker: agent

12:21
We'll talk about the philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

12:23
So step #1 is that you have to take a full-fledged mock test at the beginning of your journey, right?
Speaker: agent

12:31
Right away, you'll have to take a full-fledged mock test because you want to get to 7:05.
Speaker: agent

12:36
Fine, we'll get there.
Speaker: agent

12:37
But where are you currently?
Speaker: agent

12:38
Are you at a 555 score?
Speaker: agent

12:39
Are you at a 505?
Speaker: agent

12:41
Are you at a 605495?
Speaker: agent

12:42
Because your starting score will determine the entire action plan for you.
Speaker: agent

12:47
So step #1 you'll have to take a mock test.
Speaker: agent

12:49
So for example, let me click on this here.
Speaker: agent

12:51
These are the Sigma X mock tests.
Speaker: agent

12:53
So if you're an AG mad student, you'll go and you'll take the mock test #1 if you look at this student, the student took a mock test, got a 595 to begin with.
Speaker: agent

13:01
He's executed the entire study plan.
Speaker: agent

13:04
Got to 715-7051.
Speaker: agent

13:06
The mock test on the real GMAT as well.
Speaker: agent

13:08
Go to a 705.
Speaker: agent

13:09
That's how your journey would look like.
Speaker: agent

13:10
Mock test #1 would be a low score, but the other mock test will be high scores because you executed the study plan like that.
Speaker: agent

13:16
That, that, that is the idea.
Speaker: agent

13:18
Now what we are looking for in mock test number one is you have a 595 score.
Speaker: agent

13:22
Let's say, OK, fine, 595.
Speaker: agent

13:25
Within that 595, what is your verbal percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:28
What is your quant percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:30
What is your data insights percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:32
We want to know that.
Speaker: agent

13:33
Now when I look at this, I can clearly say that this student is naturally weaker on the verbal side, but this guy has good skills by default in data insights.
Speaker: agent

13:42
Naturally, this guy is stronger there in your case as well.
Speaker: agent

13:45
We'll see.
Speaker: agent

13:46
Handily speaking, what do you think about your strengths and weaknesses?
Speaker: agent

13:49
Verbal, quant and data insights, how would they be?
Speaker: agent

13:53
Are you comfortable in quant or verbal?
Speaker: agent

13:56
Verbal and both you're you would be comfortable.
Speaker: prospect

14:01
Is that what you're saying?
Speaker: agent

14:02
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

14:04
OK.
Speaker: agent

14:04
So there is no specific strength and weaknesses.
Speaker: agent

14:06
Probably everything could be a good area.
Speaker: agent

14:08
That's what you're saying.
Speaker: agent

14:10
Data in text.
Speaker: prospect

14:12
I, I'm a little confused, but OK, Data insights could be probably a weak area because you're not familiar with those type of questions.
Speaker: prospect

14:22
Maybe.
Speaker: prospect

14:23
Yeah, that's why probably.
Speaker: prospect

14:24
OK, we'll see.
Speaker: agent

14:25
So when you take the mock test, that observation gets quantified.
Speaker: agent

14:29
So you might get a very low score in data insights in the mock test, but get a good score in verbal and probably we'll see that.
Speaker: agent

14:35
Now another thing which we which the mock test will tell us is within Verbal in CR and RC, what are the current percentile scores?
Speaker: agent

14:44
Maybe in Verbal, you are naturally good and critical reasoning, you get a higher starting score, but you are slightly on the weaker side.
Speaker: agent

14:51
On reading comprehension, we'll get to know that.
Speaker: agent

14:53
Similarly in quant as well, we'll get to see your percentiles in algebra and arithmetic.
Speaker: agent

14:58
When you take the real GMAT or a mock test on officialmba.com, you'll get the same results, similar results where all these data points.
Speaker: agent

15:06
So in the in the EGMAT mock test as well, we are giving all these data points.
Speaker: agent

15:10
So data insights have these four types of sections.
Speaker: agent

15:13
All these sections you'll have starting scores.
Speaker: agent

15:15
This is step number number one.
Speaker: agent

15:16
Take a mock test, 2 1/2 hours, proper ideals conditions, you'll sit and you'll take a mock test.
Speaker: agent

15:22
This would happen.
Speaker: agent

15:22
This is step number one.
Speaker: agent

15:24
Step #2 is that you'll spend 5 to 10 minutes on this tool called Personalized Study Planner tool.
Speaker: agent

15:30
It will take the entire mock test score as an input, which will ask you some other questions as well.
Speaker: agent

15:35
At the end, you will see a framework that looks something like this.
Speaker: agent

15:39
This is the main study plan framework here.
Speaker: agent

15:42
This is the dummy study plan I created for a different student.
Speaker: agent

15:45
I will will not worry about that.
Speaker: agent

15:47
We'll, we'll worry about the philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

15:49
What exactly does this mean and why?
Speaker: agent

15:51
Why it is important for you.
Speaker: agent

15:53
So in this student's case, 545 is the starting score.
Speaker: agent

15:56
This student wants to get to 695.
Speaker: agent

15:58
In your case, you want to get to 705, little bit higher score, but 695 also is good for us.
Speaker: agent

16:03
If you get a 695, that's more than good enough.
Speaker: agent

16:06
We'll we'll accept that now.
Speaker: agent

16:09
Number one is that on the left hand side, you'll see all these current scores.
Speaker: agent

16:15
This student is slightly stronger in critical reasoning, weaker in reading comprehension, slightly stronger in arithmetic, little bit weaker in algebra.
Speaker: agent

16:24
That's what these numbers mean.
Speaker: agent

16:26
Now to get to a 695, there are specific targets.
Speaker: agent

16:30
Because you are stronger in critical reasoning, you are given a bigger target score, and because you are weaker in reading comprehension, you are given a smaller target score.
Speaker: agent

16:39
So somewhere a very high target score, somewhere slightly lower target score.
Speaker: agent

16:43
But the combination of all these numbers together will give us that 695 the tool determines automatically.
Speaker: agent

16:51
And this is this step is very important because you will get to your overall target in less amount of time.
Speaker: agent

16:57
If you customize your targets in your stronger area, you need less time to get a higher score.
Speaker: agent

17:02
In your weaker area, you're not even aiming for a higher score.
Speaker: agent

17:05
So you'll get done faster.
Speaker: agent

17:06
That's the idea.
Speaker: agent

17:07
So this this part is very important.
Speaker: agent

17:10
Then we, we can actually tell this tool that I can study 4 hours every day, you know, weekends I can study a little bit more amount of time, I can study 38 hours on a weekly basis.
Speaker: agent

17:22
If I study at that rate, by when can I take the GMAT?
Speaker: agent

17:27
How much time will I need for GMAT?
Speaker: agent

17:28
For example, this student can take the GMAT by 26th of March at that rate of time investment.
Speaker: agent

17:37
So if you start the preparation right away, you can take the GMAT by 26th of March.
Speaker: agent

17:41
But I want to take the GMAT by you, you, I, I means you, you have to take the GMAT by 15th of March or 14th of March, little bit earlier, right?
Speaker: agent

17:52
So how can, how would you do that?
Speaker: agent

17:54
So what you will have to do is you will have to beat the clock.
Speaker: agent

17:57
For example, in critical reasoning, it will take about 1 1/2 weeks to get to a 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

18:03
1 1/2 weeks is what, 8 days or so.
Speaker: agent

18:05
So if you start the critical reasoning preparation today, on day eight you will have a 90th percentile, but you need to try and achieve give that 90th percentile not on day 8 but on day six.
Speaker: agent

18:17
You have to save two days time.
Speaker: agent

18:18
Similarly in reading comprehension, you have to save two days time.
Speaker: agent

18:21
In arithmetic you have to save a couple of days time.
Speaker: agent

18:23
If you do that then you will you will hit that 15th of March deadline.
Speaker: agent

18:28
That is the idea.
Speaker: agent

18:30
So that that is number 1 #2 let's say you don't have a 545, let's say you have a 605 scores to begin with.
Speaker: agent

18:38
Then then automatically the tool itself will tell you that you can get ready by 13th of March.
Speaker: agent

18:43
So the more score improvement we need, the more amount of effort it takes to get a higher score.
Speaker: agent

18:50
That that's the only thing.
Speaker: agent

18:51
So that's the idea.
Speaker: agent

18:53
So if if the if the tool is saying you have to take the GMAT little bit farther than your target GMAT score, the only way to achieve your target by March 15th is by saving some time in every subsection.
Speaker: agent

19:06
That that is the idea.
Speaker: agent

19:07
There.
Speaker: agent

19:08
Now this part is clear, right?
Speaker: agent

19:10
The timeline part, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

19:12
Now coming to the overall execution part of it, because you're a beginner to the preparation as of now.
Speaker: agent

19:20
In the beginning, first 2-3 weeks, you should try to focus on one thing at a time.
Speaker: agent

19:26
You should not mix things up.
Speaker: agent

19:28
That means this is how it will go tomorrow, Tomorrow only you'll kind of have to make a decision and start actually, unfortunately we don't have any time.
Speaker: agent

19:35
So I'm saying tomorrow.
Speaker: agent

19:36
Tomorrow you'll start the preparation with verbal.
Speaker: agent

19:38
Within verbal, you'll start the preparation with critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

19:41
And for the next entire one week, only critical reasoning, nothing else.
Speaker: agent

19:46
No RC, no quant, no data inserts, complete focus on critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

19:50
To become an expert in critical reasoning, At the end of that one week, we will give you a bunch of tests.
Speaker: agent

19:56
In all those tests, you have to get this 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

19:59
If that happens, you're done with CR.
Speaker: agent

20:02
That is the idea there, what what to do in that one week.
Speaker: agent

20:05
I'll show it to you.
Speaker: agent

20:05
But that's the idea.
Speaker: agent

20:06
So start tomorrow, spend one week on critical reasoning, get to a 90th percentile score, then come to reading comprehension.
Speaker: agent

20:14
Spend another one week on reading comprehension, get to an 80th percentile score, then go to quant.
Speaker: agent

20:19
In quant again, you'll spend another two weeks, arithmetic first, then algebra, and you'll try to achieve these target scores.
Speaker: agent

20:25
But here when you are studying two weeks for quant, you won't you won't just leave verbal aside you during the weekends you will spend little bit more time and take some verbal mock tests.
Speaker: agent

20:39
That way you'll stay in touch with the verbal topic without forgetting about it and the scores also should be good.
Speaker: agent

20:44
Then we'll come to data insights.
Speaker: agent

20:46
You're not fully familiar with data insights, so we'll spend about 3 weeks or so in data insights and the one topic at a time we'll pick up, We'll try to achieve the target scores.
Speaker: agent

20:55
And while doing data insights for three weeks, every weekend you will take verbal and quant sectional mock test together back-to-back.
Speaker: agent

21:04
So that way you are trying to build the stamina for the main test as well.
Speaker: agent

21:07
Every year earlier you handled only verbal tests.
Speaker: agent

21:10
Now we are adding quant tests into the mix.
Speaker: agent

21:12
Then we will add data data insert tests into the mix as well.
Speaker: agent

21:16
Then finally we'll take the full length mock tests like that.
Speaker: agent

21:19
So in the EG MAT course, you have about 55 zero sectional mock tests.
Speaker: agent

21:24
You won't take all of them, no need to take all of them, but they are there and you have the full length mock tests as well.
Speaker: agent

21:29
So that's how it is how, how to divide the next 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

21:33
That was clear, right?
Speaker: agent

21:34
Two weeks for verbal, 2 weeks for quant, 3 weeks for data inserts like that.
Speaker: agent

21:37
OK, now let's go to the execution part.
Speaker: agent

21:42
So I said start the preparation tomorrow with critical reasoning and with verbal and within one week wrap it up.
Speaker: agent

21:49
So exactly how that one week would look like.
Speaker: agent

21:51
I'll give you that understanding.
Speaker: agent

21:53
That way you'll have a much more clearer picture.
Speaker: agent

21:55
So whatever the learning architecture that we discussed for critical reasoning right now, the learning architecture remains same for every other topic as well.
Speaker: agent

22:05
So that that that part is there.
Speaker: agent

22:07
Now let's go and see the critical reasoning part.
Speaker: agent

22:10
So let's go to this verbal and master.
Speaker: agent

22:15
So critical reasoning is here.
Speaker: agent

22:17
We'll have to start the preparation with critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

22:21
Right now we are interested in learning a bunch of things and practicing a bunch of things in critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

22:28
Then we will do the testing part.
Speaker: agent

22:29
The stage #2 is the testing part.
Speaker: agent

22:31
Stage number one is the learning practice part.
Speaker:

22:34
And before critical reasoning, you will notice there is a foundation module called master comprehension.
Speaker:

22:40
Let's say you took a mock test tomorrow morning, and in the mock test, your verbal score came out to be slightly lower.
Speaker:

22:47
Slightly lower means 40 percentile or 50 percentile or lower than that.
Speaker:

22:52
That means basics and foundation is not good.
Speaker:

22:55
So we have to start the preparation from basics and foundation, which is called master comprehension.
Speaker:

22:59
That's the idea.
Speaker:

23:00
Let's say tomorrow in the mock test you got a 70 percentile in verbal.
Speaker:

23:04
Then we don't need to worry about the basics.
Speaker:

23:06
So it it really depends on the starting score right now, I'm assuming that I know you're just new to the GMAT and beginner.
Speaker:

23:14
Probably you may get a little bit lower score.
Speaker:

23:16
I'm assuming that if you get a good score tomorrow, I'm I'll be very happy.
Speaker:

23:19
But but that we'll discuss based on as if you're going to get a little bit lower score.
Speaker:

23:23
So master comprehension, you'll spend some time, you'll do the entire foundation module properly, you'll understand, and you'll take some of these quizzes and everything.
Speaker: agent

23:32
Once that is quickly done, we'll move on to critical reasoning.
Speaker:

23:35
So in critical reasoning, you have all these 10 topics, inference, assumptions, strengthen, weaken, boldface.
Speaker: agent

23:41
These are all the topics.
Speaker:

23:43
Your goal is to build expertise in all these topics in the next one week.
Speaker:

23:50
Day one, day 2, day three, day four, day 5, all these topics need to be done in five days or so.
Speaker:

23:55
That that is, that is the idea now.
Speaker:

23:57
Now the good The thing is whenever you open a so there are two things you have to do these topics in the right sequence.
Speaker:

24:05
First you have to learn what is premise, what is conclusion.
Speaker:

24:09
Then you have to learn what is inference.
Speaker: agent

24:10
Then you have to figure out how to find assumptions.
Speaker:

24:13
Then evaluate strength and we can in that sequence only you have to do if you skip the sequence, it will be very logical way of studying.
Speaker:

24:20
So that will be a big problem.
Speaker:

24:22
That's that's that sequence is very important and these kind of sequences and all will not be there in that OG book.
Speaker: agent

24:28
That OG book is straightforward practice.
Speaker:

24:30
That's why I'm recommending not to do that alone.
Speaker: agent

24:33
Then whenever you open a topic, you'll see a bunch of files here.
Speaker:

24:37
But there is a right way of doing here.
Speaker: agent

24:39
For example, this 2.1 to 2.5, these are all concept video lessons each 20 minutes video lesson would be there.
Speaker:

24:45
So concept video lessons will try to teach the theoretical part of it, what is inference, So how to do it, how to visualize all those things theoretical part.
Speaker:

24:53
Now, the most important thing here is every video lesson after 20 minutes, it ends with a quiz that you have to take that quiz and I need to see a very good score, 80 percent, 90% or 100%, something like that.
Speaker:

25:05
That has to happen.
Speaker: agent

25:06
That that that is the idea.
Speaker:

25:07
If you are getting very good scores, then obviously you're doing well.
Speaker: agent

25:12
If you get a low score, let's say you did a video lesson, you got a low score, 40 percent, 50%.
Speaker: agent

25:18
That means you did not understand this concept.
Speaker:

25:21
It is an explicit feedback.
Speaker:

25:23
You have to do something about that, that if you get a low score, redo the video lesson, try to get a better understanding of it or look at the solutions of the questions that you got incorrect and try to understand why exactly you, you, you went wrong.
Speaker:

25:34
While while solving those questions, you have to put in that additional effort.
Speaker: agent

25:38
When you put in that additional effort, you will take these couple of additional practice quizzes.
Speaker:

25:44
There I need to see 80 percent, 80%.
Speaker: agent

25:46
If you get a 40% score here, that's OK, as long as you get 80 percent, 80% here, that's the idea.
Speaker:

25:52
So learn something, do the test.
Speaker:

25:54
If the test is bad, relearn it, take a fresh test and get a good score, continuous loop.
Speaker:

26:01
So that's what we'll do.
Speaker:

26:03
Then comes application video lessons.
Speaker:

26:05
Till now you learnt the theory of inference, you know the theory, but how do you solve the questions?
Speaker: agent

26:11
When you see a question, what is your step one?
Speaker: agent

26:13
What is your Step 2?
Speaker: agent

26:14
What is your step three?
Speaker:

26:15
That step by step method you have to learn from this application video lessons again, they'll there will be quizzes at the end.
Speaker:

26:22
You have to get 80 percent, 90%, eighty percent, 90%, something like that.
Speaker:

26:26
If that happens, that means you are able to solve the questions.
Speaker:

26:29
You, you know the theory, you know the method and the method is working for you.
Speaker:

26:34
That's what it would mean.
Speaker:

26:35
At that point, we will do immediately some additional practice and you'll have to get all good scores That, that, that is the idea there.
Speaker:

26:42
So all these numbers together, they're telling me a story about your your performance in the topic inference, whether you are an expert in inference or still some weaknesses there in inference or do we have to do the entire inference Once again, something whatever it is, we'll get to know from these numbers.
Speaker: agent

26:58
That is the idea.
Speaker:

27:00
So clear till now, right?
Speaker:

27:02
Yeah.
Speaker:

27:03
Oh, OK, that is good.
Speaker:

27:04
And each and every topic as well will be like that.
Speaker:

27:07
Only whichever topic you open, you'll have to do the concept, application, practice quizzes and you'll have to get all these good scores.
Speaker: agent

27:14
That is the one topic at a time.
Speaker:

27:15
So day one, inference and assumption over day 2, evaluate and strengthen over.
Speaker:

27:20
Day three, weekend is over, Day 4, boldface is over.
Speaker:

27:23
So in 5-6 days, you have to wrap up the entire thing.
Speaker:

27:26
I mean that we have to do that oral.
Speaker: agent

27:28
We don't have much choice there.
Speaker:

27:30
Now one one additional step here is that in the EG MAT course, whenever you are taking these bunch of quizzes, you kind of have to figure out whether the score is good or not.
Speaker: agent

27:41
For example, this 50% may be a good score actually, because the quiz is very difficult here.
Speaker:

27:46
This 86% may not be a good score because this quiz may be easier.
Speaker:

27:51
So there could be some differences like that.
Speaker:

27:53
So what we do is we have this some tool called Journey View.
Speaker:

27:57
Whenever you take a quiz here, you will compare yourself with other people.
Speaker:

28:02
For example, in this particular quiz application tool, everybody else on the EG MAP platform on an average got 50% score.
Speaker: agent

28:10
You got a 75% score.
Speaker: agent

28:12
That means you are outperforming others.
Speaker:

28:14
That's what we want.
Speaker:

28:15
So grade is a grade.
Speaker:

28:16
A grade means you are performing better than others.
Speaker: agent

28:19
B grade means you are performing exactly same as others.
Speaker:

28:22
Other people got 75.
Speaker:

28:23
You also got 75.
Speaker:

28:25
That 75 number looks bigger, but it's not really a great score.
Speaker:

28:29
That's what it is.
Speaker:

28:30
Grade B means grade C means you are performing lower than others.
Speaker:

28:35
That's when you have to redo the entire video lesson.
Speaker:

28:38
So grade A grade B is fine.
Speaker:

28:41
Fine.
Speaker:

28:41
Grade C is not fine at all.
Speaker:

28:43
That that is the idea.
Speaker:

28:44
And when you do the entire critical reasoning course completely in the next 5-6 days, you will see these learning level grades as well.
Speaker: agent

28:51
All the topics will be clubbed into 4 levels and overall you are getting A grade.
Speaker:

28:56
All these 4A grades me, your account should look like this.
Speaker:

28:59
I need to see all A grades.
Speaker:

29:00
That means your preparation has been done very well.
Speaker:

29:03
You know all the concepts of critical reasoning, you know the right method to solve the questions, and you have solved A bunch of questions, and the method is working for you.
Speaker: agent

29:11
That means you're getting all A grades.
Speaker:

29:13
So if you get all A grades, that means you're almost done with CR.
Speaker:

29:17
You're ready for CR.
Speaker:

29:18
If I see B grade, C grade, something like that, that means no, you're not done with CR.
Speaker: agent

29:22
Still you have problems.
Speaker:

29:24
That's the idea.
Speaker:

29:26
These grades are an indicator for us till now, clear, right?
Speaker: agent

29:29
The overall philosophy of it.
Speaker:

29:31
So you start with critical reasoning in that you have a target of five days to complete critical reasoning we have, we have to wrap up each and every topic.
Speaker:

29:38
In each topic you have the theory lessons, application lessons, practice quizzes and get all good scores.
Speaker:

29:43
That's the idea now.
Speaker: agent

29:47
So we said you have to get to a 90th percentile score in about one week or so, 8 days or so, five days, six days you have spent on the learning aspects and practice aspects, whatever we have discussed till now.
Speaker:

30:00
5-6 days you took the next two days you have to do assessments.
Speaker:

30:05
So that's what we will discuss.
Speaker: agent

30:06
Now you will go to this quizzing platform, Wordbill Scholaranium.
Speaker: agent

30:09
So you can actually follow these instructions as it is because I'll give you the video recording, I'll do the I'll give you this.
Speaker: agent

30:15
But yeah, so you'll have to go to this Verbal Scholar Indium quizzing platform.
Speaker:

30:19
You will, you will take something called cementing quizzes.
Speaker:

30:23
These are the standardized quizzes here in Critical Reasoning.
Speaker:

30:27
You will have to take about 3 to 4 medium difficulty level quizzes, three to four very hard difficulty level quizzes as well.
Speaker:

30:34
And the platform will give you some target scores, like you want to get to 90th percentile in critical reasoning.
Speaker:

30:43
That means in hard level questions, at least 70% accuracy should be there.
Speaker: agent

30:48
In medium level questions, at least 90% accuracy should be there.
Speaker:

30:52
You when you take these bunch of quizzes, you have to hit all those targets.
Speaker: agent

30:56
5, you took 5 medium difficulty level quizzes, 9090909090.
Speaker:

31:01
You took five hard difficulty level quizzes, 70%, Seventy percent, 70 percent, 70%.
Speaker:

31:06
If this happens, you're actually done with critical reasoning that that that is the idea there and you will actually see all those scores and, and this kind of graphs and all will be parted.
Speaker: agent

31:17
For example, this is the student who took the medium difficulty level quizzes for critical reasoning.
Speaker:

31:23
This guy's target is set at 70% and quiz number one, this guy got 50%.
Speaker: prospect

31:30
That's why we are calling it fail.
Speaker:

31:31
You have failed in that particular quiz.
Speaker: prospect

31:33
That's OK.
Speaker:

31:34
If here in this particular quizzing stage, if you're getting lower scores, it's completely OK.
Speaker:

31:40
That's why we are reserving 2 days or three days for this entire stage.
Speaker: agent

31:44
Because what we will do is if you get low scores, you'll go to the skill data section and within critical reasoning at a topic level, you can actually see what is happening.
Speaker:

31:53
Like whenever we give you questions from this particular topic, your scores are very good.
Speaker:

31:57
But whenever we give you questions from this boldfest topic, your score is not good.
Speaker:

32:01
In hard difficulty level, there is a red flag.
Speaker:

32:03
You're getting lower.
Speaker:

32:04
Of course, in medium difficulty level, score is OK, timing is bad.
Speaker:

32:08
We can see that here.
Speaker: agent

32:09
So you if you get a low score, you would identify the weak area here.
Speaker:

32:14
You would work on the weak area.
Speaker: agent

32:15
How would you work on the weak area?
Speaker:

32:16
You would have to go back and do the learning modules once again, revise them.
Speaker:

32:20
You'll have to analyze the solutions of the questions that you got incorrect here.
Speaker: agent

32:24
Spend some time on the solutions and try and figure out where did I go wrong?
Speaker:

32:28
And once the traditional effort is put in, then we will take a fresh set of quizzes.
Speaker:

32:32
So that's what, that's why you can see this, right?
Speaker: agent

32:34
Quiz #150% looked at the weak areas and revised them on the same day.
Speaker:

32:39
Quiz #270% again did the looked at the weak areas and worked on them, then got 90% and 90%.
Speaker:

32:47
So the target is set at 70%.
Speaker:

32:49
This guy is getting 90 percent, 90%, so done.
Speaker:

32:51
Obviously this guy has improved.
Speaker: agent

32:53
Then this guy went to the hard difficulty level quizzes, weak areas are already addressed in medium difficulty practice.
Speaker:

32:59
So in the hard difficulty there is consistency, 70%, sixty percent, 70 percent, 60%.
Speaker: prospect

33:04
Target is at 55%.
Speaker:

33:06
This guy is getting 60 and 80%.
Speaker:

33:08
So fine, completely good.
Speaker:

33:09
So there is improvement and then there is consistency.
Speaker:

33:13
CR is over that, that, that, that.
Speaker: agent

33:16
That is the idea.
Speaker:

33:17
That's the philosophy we are looking at.
Speaker:

33:20
Seven days is over within.
Speaker: agent

33:22
So all these things will take about 8 days in your specific case, but we need to try to wrap it up in six days, five days, five and half days or so.
Speaker: agent

33:31
That way we can do faster, but that that's the only thing.
Speaker: agent

33:35
So, and once that CR is done, we'll go to RC.
Speaker:

33:38
We'll, you'll execute the same thing actually.
Speaker:

33:40
Then you'll go to data insights, you'll do the same thing for each topic.
Speaker: agent

33:44
You'll do the learning modules, then the quizzing platform, you'll do the learning modules and then you'll do the quizzing platform.
Speaker:

33:50
Score should be good.
Speaker:

33:51
And every, every weekend you will take this sectional mock tests that, that, that, that that will happen.
Speaker:

33:56
So all these things you would do, but you will not be doing it by yourself.
Speaker:

34:03
Actually, when you become an EG mad student, you would be assigned a dedicated mentor in the beginning of your journey.
Speaker:

34:10
And the mentor's job is to give you all these instructions in a continuous way.
Speaker:

34:15
Like for example, tomorrow you start the course, tomorrow morning you'll get a set of instructions from your mentor.
Speaker: agent

34:20
Hey, I want you to start with verbal.
Speaker: agent

34:22
I want you to start with master comprehension, complete it and come back to me.
Speaker: agent

34:26
You'll execute it and you'll tell you, you'll drop an e-mail to your mentor saying that hey, I completed it.
Speaker:

34:31
And at that point, your mentor would log into your account.
Speaker:

34:35
They will see master comprehension, how well she did the course.
Speaker:

34:38
All 100% scores are there, everything looks good.
Speaker: prospect

34:41
Then your mentor would give you the next set of instructions.
Speaker: agent

34:43
You just have to follow them, which causes to take, what scores to get, when to take, when not to take, all those things.
Speaker:

34:51
Actually, you'll get to see it from the mentor.
Speaker:

34:52
So actually you can see it here, let's say if you go to EG MAT YouTube channel, you'll see all these bunch of success stories, many of them are first time test takers as well.
Speaker: agent

35:03
Here this is the mentor the student is having an interview with here.
Speaker: agent

35:08
If you see this is another mentor, you can see that.
Speaker:

35:10
So, yeah, EG MAT by default we I mean in terms of delivering number of success stories, EG MAT delivers three times more success stories than any other test prep company.
Speaker:

35:20
You should definitely consider a course and EG Mat should you should evaluate EG MAT if you find another course to be little bit better.
Speaker: agent

35:27
It's completely fine.
Speaker: agent

35:28
This is a student who got to 655 in 30 days if you say it.
Speaker:

35:31
So she kind of kind of like your journey only we are expecting there.
Speaker:

35:36
So yeah, you can go through all these success to some of these success stories and all you can do that.
Speaker:

35:42
But yeah, that that is the idea.
Speaker:

35:43
And yeah, so this is the overall journey that you would go through and it will so far.
Speaker:

35:51
I, I want to say one thing for sure here, it won't be a easy journey.
Speaker:

35:57
The relative easiness of this 45 day journey will really depend upon your starting score.
Speaker:

36:05
If your starting score is 545 or something like that, yes, we can get this done.
Speaker:

36:11
If your starting score is 615605, then definitely we can get it done.
Speaker: agent

36:17
If your starting score is 445 or 435, something like that, it becomes very tough journey.
Speaker:

36:24
Yeah, to get it done So that, that, that, that is there and and what is that?
Speaker:

36:30
Because you have to wrap it up in 45 days.
Speaker:

36:33
You don't have the luxury to take any breaks.
Speaker:

36:35
Every day we have to study, let's say on a particular Monday, you could not study.
Speaker:

36:41
You should be in a position to take a vacation day on a Friday and put in more amount of time from office and work.
Speaker:

36:47
Those sacrifices will have to be made.
Speaker:

36:50
The, the, the, those kind of things will will have to happen and you have to plan for it.
Speaker: agent

36:55
And of course, you have unlimited strategy support over e-mail with your mentor.
Speaker:

36:58
So you can always get that recommendation from your mentor.
Speaker:

37:01
Should I take vacation days?
Speaker:

37:03
How many days should I take?
Speaker:

37:04
How much more time do I need?
Speaker:

37:05
All those questions?
Speaker:

37:06
Your mentor will be able to help you.
Speaker:

37:08
But yeah, that is the idea.
Speaker:

37:09
That's the philosophy, That's the framework that you have to go through.
Speaker:

37:12
Let me know if you have any questions.
Speaker:

37:15
No, as of now, I'm thinking of a course.
Speaker:

37:17
I'll go through everything and then definitely and I'll also share, give you this information right away.
Speaker: agent

37:26
That way you don't have to waste any time.
Speaker: agent

37:28
So if you go to the EG MAD plans and pricing page of there are two-month, 4 month, 6 month options, obviously you'll have to go with the two-month option because we have to do it in 45 days.
