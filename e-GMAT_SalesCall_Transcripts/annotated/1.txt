0:44
Hey Nikita, yes, hey, Hi Amruth, hey, hi again.

0:50
Happy New year And I assume that the set of concerns which and Nivesh has you know mentioned that that we need to address in the call.

0:59
Its the same for you as well.

1:00
Nikita.

1:01
Yes, yes.

1:04
All right, perfect.

1:05
So Nikita, before we start, help me with the mail ID in the chat.

1:12
Sorry your voice is breaking a little, Amrit.

1:15
Yeah, even I can.

1:18
Ohh.

1:18
Is it?

1:19
Yeah.

1:21
Just just let me know.

1:24
Just just give me a second.

1:30
Just give me one second.

1:31
Let me try to connect with a different device.

1:35
Just give me one second.

1:37
Yeah, sure, sure.

3:05
Hello.

3:07
Yes, Amruth.

3:10
Yeah, not sure.

3:12
Usually I just connect, you know, I just connect with that device, which generally works well.

3:18
Give me a second.

3:21
Actually, it is much clearer now.

3:26
Is it?

3:28
I had the voice earlier.

3:29
I was using Bluetooth.

3:32
What about?

3:32
No, no, no.

3:32
It is gone, completely gone, so on.

3:39
So basically, I have turned to speaker mode.

3:44
Is this fine?

3:46
Yeah, it is fine now.

3:48
Yeah, it is fine.

3:50
All right, All right.

3:50
In that case, So what I was telling is I, I require a your mail ID.

4:01
Nikita, you can just bring me a mail ID here in the chat.

4:05
Yeah, yeah, done.

4:21
Alright, perfect.

4:22
So to address your questions one by one, do you wish to see the portal and have a you know real ID?

4:33
Because the first point animation that you have mentioned is course extension.

4:37
So what do you mean by course extension animation?

4:40
What what what exactly were you referring to?

4:43
Yes.

4:44
So basically course extension as in let us say I buy 2 month course and after after 2 months let us say I feel that my preparation is not enough and if I want to extend the course so that is the case.

5:00
So for that I mailed Sandeep and then he asked me to get on the call with you.

5:05
And so I wanted to understand that thing.

5:08
So currently, do you have a valid account or is it that you're planning to start and you're looking from a future standpoint?

5:16
I'm looking from a future standpoint.

5:18
And OK, so to extend to extend, what you need is, you know, for for one month, you'd have to pay an extra of $89 per month.

5:28
So when is it?

5:30
See, I just want to understand from each of you, you know, you just starting, you are just starting your preparation, you know, have you taken any mock or anything so far  Nikita, not yet.

5:42
OK, OK.

5:43
So do you have any deadlines in, in terms of when you have to apply to schools and when do you when you have to have that score in hand?

5:53
So basically I am planning for spring index.

5:55
So deadline is around March, April, OK, close to close to 3 months time, right.

6:02
And is that, is that the same case for Nikita?

6:06
Not as often round.

6:07
I mean I am just starting to prepare for it.

6:10
And yeah, there is no hard deadline for me at least.

6:15
All right, got it, got it.

6:16
She is looking for next to next like 2027 it takes.

6:20
So she is got much more time then.

6:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6:24
Got it.

6:24
So see in, in, in either ways, either ways getting a GMAT score, maybe animation you you'd realise, right.

6:31
So, so if you, if you had look for spring intake and if you had done your GMAT previous year itself, that would have been great.

6:38
So that, that's one of the reasons I guess you would have recommended Nikita because it's always better to start early and get done with the GMAT early so that we have that Peace of Mind because it's gonna be active for 5 years.

6:48
So we can comfortably apply during the scheduled time and that we can, we can go for it.

6:54
So, so, so that's one thing regarding your extension part and Himesh, every month extension would cost you 89 on top of that.

7:05
So that's, that's how the pricing goes.

7:10
So is that, is that something which you wanted to know?

7:13
And and when you extend it of course you are gonna continue with the same you know, account duration and all these things.

7:20
So yeah, so Amrit, another thing is so I have got a mail from Sandeep that lets say I if I if I buy today within 2048 hours, so then he is going to allow me to pay the difference amount and extend the course see for 3 months.

7:42
There is to be to be honest, I will tell you if if you are looking for a 4 month standpoint that's different see for for 3 months paying the difference in the sense what was communicated to you not, not not 3 months like 4 months.

7:54
So you have got 3 slabs, right, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.

8:00
Yeah, right.

8:02
So if I want to extend for 4 months, he said you can pay the difference amount and then I will allow you to get enroll for 4 months.

8:12
Yeah.

8:12
So that would be see I, I will tell you in that case what he would have meant is see we are you know the, the 4 months course would be priced at 2:00 $99 like $299 4 months course and 2 months course is priced at 1:00 $99.

8:31
And we are also running some discounts at the moment.

8:33
So it will be 159.

8:36
So I, I will check back and come come to you on what was communicated because if you if you look at from the different standpoint.

8:44
So if you are getting at a, it will be 159, right.

8:49
And then if you have to pay 299 anyways, it's gonna cost you the same.

8:53
And if you're directly purchasing 4 months, you have that with a discounted price right now for 249.

9:00
So that is one one aspect that is what my query is.

9:05
So that was very unclear there and that's why I wanted to get on call with you so I can so if you want, I can send you the screenshot mail for your.

9:14
Can you just share share your screen to me?

9:16
Can you just share your screen to me?

9:17
 yeah okay, can you now?

9:34
Yeah I can I can see your screen yeah, I can see your screen.

9:39
So not this, yeah, this is so I had this query regarding the course, course extension.

9:50
OK.

9:51
Then I got this mail from Sandeep from GMAT.

9:55
You can verify the email again.

9:57
Sandeep is my colleague.

9:58
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:00
So he said Ki, thank you for writing.

10:02
And like you said, you are going to charge $89.

10:06
How where to make your decision easier and to encourage your start right away, I can do the following for you.

10:13
As an exception, if you are ready to start in next 48 hours, I can secure an approval to offer the following exclusive offer for you.

10:20
You can purchase 2 month course as of now in 30 days of first purchase, you can anytime pay the difference in price and upgrade to the 4 months course.

10:27
Yeah, so this would be over here.

10:34
So So what you wanted is also regarding this discounted price only right So what you wanted was to pay 159 now and get that discounted price of 249 as a difference.

10:44
that's what you wanted right Yeah yeah like yeah yeah.

10:48
So you can you can get that, but the contingencies is clear.

10:52
You know you have to you know reach out to us and you know you know get it done within 30 days.

10:58
So so this is just for you to get it started.

11:02
Suppose if so, so the reason why it is being mentioned is even though you just for the sake of money, let's not, you know, hold on to our preparation is what exactly it meant.

11:15
So the idea behind this message for you is to, you know, make it clear because of this confusion regarding you know which to go by.

11:24
Let's not waste time.

11:25
So you know the reason why something had mentioned is because if you if you are confused between starting 2 months and 4 months and that's what is keeping you delayed.

11:34
Let's not wait for that.

11:35
Let let us make it easier for you.

11:38
What you can do is you can pay for 2 months if that's that's what you're looking at pay for 2 months and you'll have 30 days to decide if if you have to go for 4 months or just continue with 2 months.

11:50
So you'll have that option if you wish to continue for 4 months within 30 days, you'd have a very clear idea in terms of if you would want to extend it for 4 months or not.

11:58
And if you don't want to extend for 4 months, of course you'd have this for 19.

12:03
So the message is clear, you, you're for 249.

12:06
So you'll have to pay the difference from 249 to 159.

12:10
You can pay the difference within 30 days of time.

12:12
That that, that that part is, you know, clear right.

12:16
Animation.

12:17
OK, So that 4 month price will be 249 only.

12:19
So that will be just like, yeah, yeah.

12:22
So that that's what you enquire also about, right?

12:24
Because if it is you know $299 it doesn't make sense because any which is you know it will not make sense.

12:30
So you replied with the help of this you know discount coupon which is there, you were confused.

12:38
We did not go for 2 months discounted price or 4 months discounted price.

12:41
And you, you are in that dilemma and to help you out for a better situation, to put you in a better situation, we have given you that offer which you can think about and come back.

12:52
OK.

12:52
And similar it is for 6 months as well right or what 6 months also.

12:57
But yeah within 30 days you will have to you know confirm.

13:00
OK, yeah that that's it.

13:02
Either way.

13:02
Either way, maybe, maybe you can reply on that mail with the same thing with the discounted price because I have got another from Jessica as well about the prices that I have recently replied to her as well about this is the price.

13:21
These are the prices currently as of now.

13:24
Yeah, yeah.

13:24
See, see, we so, so this is a standard pricing or discounted pricing which is there.

13:30
So even even for, you know, all, all the students, it will be the standard pricing of 159 to 499319.

13:37
That's a discounted pricing which is there.

13:40
So whatever we discussed, you have reverted on, on, on this, right?

13:44
This is what you referred to.

13:45
So, so so you can decide.

13:48
So we will have 30 days to decide if to go for 4 months paying the difference or 6 months paying the difference or not to you know if 2 months is enough for you.

13:58
Yeah, yeah, but there but if you want to extend it for say 3 months, if that's or 15 days, we also have 15 days extension.

14:07
We just need to pay $49 in that case you don't have to after around 30 days when it is around 25 plus days, you can decide if to extend for 15 days.

14:16
Is that your your priority after because you have time till you know 2 months anyways you are going to purchase for 2 months.

14:23
So you will have a clarity within 25 days how how it is progressing.

14:27
And if you think that 15 days is enough, you can actually towards the end of end of 2 months you can actually purchase 15 days extension for $49 or $89 for one month extension.

14:38
You can do that.

14:39
But if you are, if you want to go for 4 months, you can pay the difference.

14:41
And so which is around $90 again, $89 for the same $89 that you are paying extra, you are going to get 2 months.

14:48
That's the difference, right?

14:49
So you're gonna get that.

14:51
Maybe you can, yeah, maybe you can reply on that mail and confirm that you, you revert to just, I'm not in the loop, right?

14:59
First, first you include me in the loop, then I'll revert to you.

15:03
If you can just reply on the mail with me in or addressing me keeping the same people in CC or the records and you can tell that as discussed, you know whenever you are planning to purchase, you can tell that as discussed, I would be paying 2 months now and I would like to within 30 days I will revert on the extended duration.

15:27
If it is 4 months or 6 months which I want to go, I will pay that difference with the offer amount and you know we can mention 249 and 319.

15:35
So just keep me also in loop.

15:38
Yeah, so I have a clarity.

15:42
Is this your this thing dot com?

15:45
Yeah, you can.

15:46
This is my mail.

15:48
So does it work and you can just put it forward and continue with that.

15:53
That is one thing and see if hypothetically, you know, you just wanted to understand from Nikita's end, you would Nikita, when are you planning to start?

16:05
See one, one more thing which I would like to tell you is if Nikita and animation, if you are both planning to start on the same day or purchasing on the same day, we can actually give you some extension of 15 days or something for free.

16:19
You don't even have to pay for it if, if that's the case.

16:22
So because we consider that as a referral kind of thing and out of courtesy, we do that.

16:27
If if that's something which you are looking at and you know, let that not be the only driving factor.

16:32
But but of course, if you would like to see the course and all these things, I can quickly give you a view of that as well for you, for each of you.

16:40
But yeah, so if both of you are purchasing on the same day for each of you, Nikita as well as animation will give you a 15 days extension which is worth $49.

16:51
That too would be added towards the end of you know of your 2 months journey.

16:56
Whichever course you are purchasing be 2 months, 4 months or 6 months you are going to have we will give you an extension of 15 days you know out of courtesy so that that we can think of if if you're purchasing on the same day OK now actually I will let you know about that because I'm I'm at very beginners stage right now right right.

17:19
Yeah.

17:20
So I'm still in deciding zone and once I once I go through because you have time right Yeah Nikita, I understand you have time.

17:28
So just just letting you know on on this element, but you know, it's completely on you anyways, you know, but that's not the main point.

17:38
So I'll just share my screen and just quickly show you as well on in terms of, you know, how the course would be laid out and all these things.

17:47
And, you know, first of all, each of you would ask both of you to, you know, start with the test.

17:54
So it's very important.

17:55
You don't have to be prepared.

17:57
You don't have to have a, you know, brush up.

17:59
You don't have to go through all those things, but you know, the first thing that we'd recommend is to take up a test to understand what about GMAT.

18:06
You'll have getting started videos where you understand what you know how the GMAT scoring works, how to you know how the e GMAT learning architecture works.

18:13
All these things you're gonna cover about the tests.

18:15
Also, you're gonna have a clarity.

18:17
So animation.

18:17
Nikita, I hope each of you are aware about the GMAT scoring patterns and the, the you know, the elements are you, No, no, no, we are so yeah.

18:29
So GMAT you know, we earlier had a classic edition and now we have something called Focus Edition and we had a couple of things which is being removed.

18:40
And in Focus edition we have few things which added.

18:42
So you know, in in classic edition we had only verbal and quant section, only 2 sections where in quants you had, you know, geometry which is now removed in the Focus edition.

18:54
In vowel you would had you had sentence correction, analytical writing kind of things which is also removed and a new section is added called data insights and this is section which is is being added as new.

19:09
So.

19:11
So right now we have 3 sections 45 minutes each for each of the sessions and you will have 23 questions on verbal, 21 questions in quants and 20 questions in data insights.

19:23
That is how the question layout happens.

19:25
And each, each you know, section has a scores, you know, score set ranging from 60 to 90.

19:32
That is verbal 60 to verbal 90, quant 60 to quant 90.

19:35
That is Q 60 to Q 90 and D 60 to D 90.

19:38
That's what the scoring range or the spectrum of scores that you can get.

19:42
That's a scale score.

19:43
We call it scale score that determines your, your total score.

19:47
So the the scoring of GMAT starts from 205 to 805205 being the lowest and 805 being the perfect score.

19:56
So that's how it is.

19:57
And what are the schools that each of you are targeting?

20:01
Can you just help me with once more?

20:02
And do you have any idea of what should be the scores that you need to chase?

20:08
Yeah around 635.

20:10
I am planning for some top BB schools.

20:14
So my target score, when I spoke with MB&B and and some of other consultancies, they said yeah, I need to be scoring around 685 and all.

20:25
Yeah, 685 would be 96 percentile, Nikita.

20:28
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:30
That's that's for the top B schools.

20:33
We have to have at least 685 around.

20:36
Yeah.

20:37
So if you are looking for, you know, schools outside India, of course you would have to go beyond that.

20:42
If you are looking for say Harvard, Stanford or you know NCR, all the schools maybe based on your profile, 685 would be a competence score, but something about 700 7 not 5 would be ideal.

20:54
Like around 98 percentile would be helping you get a kind of scholarships and other things If you are looking for that that would do.

21:00
But if you are looking for Indian schools like NCR or London Business School for these schools, the median range is 655 is a median score, but we have to have 20 to 30 point improvement for those schools.

21:10
If you are looking for London Business School or beat, you know Indian School of Business, ISB Hyderabad or for for these schools, a score of 685695 would do.

21:20
And even the round one application which is happening in this September for ISVCISV saw schools, you know, ISV offers even up to 100% scholarships.

21:31
Most schools does most of the top schools offers up to 100% scholarships in the round one and subsequent rounds you would see a decline in the scholarship percentage.

21:41
So ideally we should be looking for getting those scholarships in place with a really high GMAT score.

21:46
That's that's something which you need to target and to get a 685, you have to have an average of 848484 each in your quants verbal and data inside section a score of 848484 on an average.

21:59
That is what you need to chase.

22:01
That is your magical number.

22:02
If your target is 685, your magical number is 252.

22:07
That is 848484.

22:08
That can come in any combination.

22:10
If if hypothetically verbal and you know in quants you have 84 in verbal you have you know only 80 or you know in data instance you have only 80, quant you have 84.

22:22
So in verbal you have to go to 88 to make sure that you are getting that 252 as a sum of scores and you have to get A25021 way or the other any based on any combination.

22:33
And to get there is what you know, we would create this study plan.

22:38
So based on your initial targets.

22:40
So that's why we ask you to first take a test without any preparation where what exactly are you in in the raw form to understand what exactly is your position and accordingly create a study plan.

22:50
Suppose most of the students do this mistake, they will think that OK, let me do a revision on my own and then we will come back and take a course.

22:57
It is not actually required because the course in itself is going to cover from the fundamentals.

23:01
If we see for verbal, we have only critical reasoning and reading comprehension as the main section.

23:06
But we have something called master comprehension which covers your fundamentals, which is actually going to build a strong fundamentals for your verbal and and similarly for quants.

23:15
If you look at we have all the main sections, arithmetic and algebra.

23:18
Arithmetic would be comprising of number of properties, portfolios, advanced topics and algebra is the another section.

23:23
But before that we have quant basics.

23:25
So technically you don't require any prerequisites you know to to start your preparation.

23:31
That's how the course in itself is designed.

23:33
But the another aspect is you know, within the course, the, the within the platform in itself, you are actually going to get feedback every 30 minutes within the platform if you are going, you know, doing things in the right way or, or you are getting derailed from the actual study.

23:48
So we have this algorithm which helps you understand in real time every 30 minutes if you are, you know, preparing in the right direction.

23:57
And you will also have mentor support animation Nikita.

24:02
So mentor support is from day one, you would be a mentor would be assigned animation.

24:06
If you are purchasing say today, within 24 hours, a mentor would be assigned to you.

24:10
It will be a dedicated mentor from day one till you are tested.

24:12
So what they will be doing is they, they would be, you know, giving you, you know, the first during the first connects you, you, you, you are going to get a certain set of task.

24:22
You are going to do those tasks and come back and they are going to evaluate it and you know, they, they are going to give you feedback and then you are going to go to the next set of task.

24:29
So, so you would be getting on a chain of communication from that point of time.

24:33
And and Himesh, I am going to send you in WhatsApp a detailed video regarding what the mentor support is.

24:40
Who could could you could you just share it with Nikita as well for her to understand?

24:45
Sure.

24:45
If I send it to you.

24:46
Yeah, yeah.

24:48
So that would cover you a great idea in terms of what covers in the mentor support and how your mentor support is actually going to help you in terms of your prep.

24:57
So you know that that that is that is one one aspect.

25:01
And you know what, what else the are we planning to discuss today?

25:11
And one more thing regarding the feedbacks and all these things.

25:13
If you could see if you look at say critical reasoning.

25:16
So there are a lot of, you know, elements within it.

25:19
So each of the files that you see the, the learning modules would have first conceptual videos, then application videos to ensure that you are applying the concepts or techniques.

25:27
We call it can call it tips and tricks or all these things that you learn in in real GMAT questions and understand if you are able to apply those without worrying about time that is application files.

25:37
Then we look at the time space in a practice quiz mode in terms of each type of question.

25:41
Once each type of questions are done, we are stage one is done.

25:44
So once your stage one is done, see we will have a starting score.

25:47
We have a target score.

25:48
We have to get to that score.

25:49
It does not happen overnight.

25:51
Your learning is going to be progressive and it is very important that you track.

25:54
Trackability is one of the things that you have to understand because when you take up a course for say 4 months or 6 months or 2 months, it is not just the money commitment that you are doing, it's also the time commitment that you are involved in.

26:07
So that's one one of the biggest you know, you know, you know, commitments that you give and it has to be utilised in the right way and you have to have a clear understanding if it is helping you, is it are you improving?

26:18
You know, just sitting and working on it blindly for situation, then realising that I'm nowhere is too devastating.

26:25
So what we have to understand and our course in itself is designed is to give you feedbacks and help you understand as you cross each milestone in terms of your scores and you thereby know from which code to which code you are progressing.

26:37
Suppose if you are starting with 4 hundreds, you, you know when you reach 450, then you when you reach 5 hundreds, 556 hundreds, you are going to have a clarity.

26:47
And that would put in a really good position in terms of understanding your progressing and also give you that confidence that OK, you are going in the right track without without getting debated.

26:55
And that's why you have a mentor also.

26:57
So would to to have give that kind of a clarity, you'll also have a calendar view.

27:02
Of course, even though mentor support is there, you're going to have a calendar view to understand in terms of what activities have to be done on a daily basis.

27:08
And on a weekly basis.

27:10
You also have this time commitment calendar where you can always come and adjust.

27:14
And if any of the particularity you committed say 2 hours or 3 hours and you couldn't show up for that particularity, you can come and mark it as a no study day.

27:21
So that your mentor would also have a clarity that that particular day you are not able to study.

27:25
If in case you you are able to study only one hour, you're going to come and mark it as one hour.

27:30
Or if if that turned out to be a holiday, you were able to put 6 hours of prep, you're going to do that as well.

27:34
So accordingly a calendar and schedule would adjust itself.

27:38
That makes it really, you know, convenient in terms of managing your prep.

27:43
And, and next element is for each of the files, you are going to have a grading system where you are going to compare yourself to your peers and the global population.

27:51
So we are going to compare for each of the files that you take, you know, how well you are doing compared to your peers in the global population.

27:58
What's the median first item score and what's your first item score?

28:01
Accordingly, you are going to get a grade and these grades does not require, again like the way I said, you don't require any pre, you know, information to get a high score because we are going to test you only on things that we teach.

28:13
So of course we are going to teach from the fundamentals.

28:15
Someone who is already strong.

28:17
Suppose if hypothetically, if animation is, you know really strong in the fundamentals and and as well as the code thing verbally is a very strong area for  may not be for Nikita or either you know vice versa.

28:29
So in in either of the scenario, the what what happens is animation would go through things faster.

28:36
There there not be any difference in grades.

28:38
If both of you are doing the course really well.

28:40
What you would realise is you you would be skimming animal should be skimming through things faster with grade is throughout Nikita you take more time in in understanding grasping things and then going by and getting grade you might take a bit more time than him that that is the that is going to be the difference majorly and based on the aggregate grades here you see level zero, level one, level 2, Level 3 grades as you progress.

29:04
Suppose if it is CR from 28 percentile once you complete your video, you know the lessons that you complete.

29:10
Once you finish that you are going to realise that you would be in a spectrum between 48 percentile to around 78 percentile.

29:15
So what determines which towards which side are you?

29:19
Are you towards that lower end of the spectrum or higher end of the spectrum is based on your grades.

29:23
So you get a clear cut clarity from your mentor in terms of what exactly are your current percentile levels.

29:29
And if you are getting a 70 percentile during the course, if you are consistently getting all grade is that is an indicator that you have the quality of learning that you have done in stage one is you know really good.

29:41
And once once we do that, just just give me a second.

29:43
It is just malfunctioning.

29:46
Yeah, Amrit, it's I see the platform is very comprehensive.

29:51
It's very good.

29:52
But I see so there will be that mentor assigned to us, right.

29:58
To show what to use and how to use this platform, right.

30:02
This is no, it's not for how to use the platform.

30:05
See mentor support is not for that.

30:08
It's much beyond it's they, they are gonna be the complete, you know, instructor or the guide for your complete GMAT journey.

30:15
And those are the people see our platform.

30:17
If if you are purchasing a course, I always tell my student that you are paying only around 60 to 70% for your platform and the course and the quizzes, all this practice quizzes or whatever it is that you see not here you are going to have a separate platform for practice in Ch 2 where you are going to have your track, your improvements and all the things you are going to do.

30:36
So all those I would still say is maximum 70% is your weightage and 30% is the mental support.

30:44
And you have to actually, you know, make sure that you are utilising it to your full list.

30:48
And towards the end of your prepsi, the the main aspect or the main the game of your menta is initially when when you connect with them and, and you when you have a communication with them and all these things, you are going to get a clear instruction.

31:02
When, especially when you are at a 635 or lesser, you're going to get a very clear instruction in terms of what to do and how to do and all this since you're going to get a clarity.

31:09
But within the platform itself, you will see that we have, we capture a lot of data points, data information, your average correct time, incorrect time, your accuracy, your behavioral patterns.

31:18
We capture a lot of data with which once you reach a 635, we will be able to enroll you in a program called Last Mile Push that is 2 data intensive.

31:28
And you know, see the difference between someone, if I take 2 people, person A and person B1 is at 6:35, one is at 7:35.

31:35
The difference between both of the people, if I, if I give them a GMAT test and give them 10 hours to do, both of them would have a same kind of accuracy there, their scores would be marginally different.

31:45
So there will be very less margin of their difference in scores.

31:48
The reason is because once you reach a 635, there will not be anything further that you can actually learn or see a video or listen to any lecture and going to improve.

31:58
It's, it's not going to happen.

31:59
You have to have a personalised you know structure and you have to identify your strengths, weakness and then do a fine tuning and improve on your timing.

32:07
So beyond 635 it is all about the timing game, not about the conceptual clarity all all this things.

32:13
So you will have to require a lot of fine tuning for which we enrolled in last mile push program and all this things that details of which I would be sending it to you.

32:20
So the main aspect is you are not going to pay for anything else you know after your first payment point.

32:26
After that there is no other purchase that you have to do within the course to get all this all done in 2 months.

32:32
Only that last mile push and everything.

32:34
See to to be honest , I'll tell you.

32:37
Suppose if you are you know, the first second diagnostic vision, all these things.

32:41
And if your score is say already at A575585 and you have you know, at least 25 hours to give on a weekly basis preparation 2 months would do for you to get a 685.

32:52
But it's it's subjective.

32:54
If you are not getting say 575580 5:00 in the test that you take instead you are getting say 515 or 495, then 2 months might not be enough.

33:03
You have to go for 4 months of prep and there are students who can give a maximum who's who's having a very high working schedule, very hectic working schedule, would eventually have only 15 hours of work time and they are currently at say around 4 50s.

33:17
They recommend them to take 6 months and anything more than 6 months.

33:21
If you are taking for your preparation, that means that you are doing it wrong because GMAT is a kind of test which has a very defined syllabus, defined type of questions.

33:29
Indeed, if you look at say critical listening, you are going to get questions only from these type of questions.

33:34
Within critical reason we have only 9 types, inference, assumption, evaluate, strengthen, weaken, boldface.

33:39
In miscellaneous you have around 3 types, FIB, flop, paradox.

33:43
These are your only type of cases that can ever come in a test.

33:46
So the the key is in mastering each type of question unlike cat or other test.

33:51
This is the biggest advantage that you would have with GMAT because you have very definite type of questions and very different type of questions which can come in a test.

34:00
So it is about learning the right technique for each type of question and for that how many hours that you have to give within the course.

34:07
You are going to have a very clear clarity as well on how long within verbal, how many hours you have to give within months, how many hours have you have to give within data and says how many hours you have to give and you are going to have a tentative GMAT test date as well.

34:20
So animation all this things would help you understand if this time is enough.

34:25
So you like the way we said if you are purchasing for 2 months within day one you are going to do this you know and create a study plan within one day itself.

34:34
So within day one you would realise how long you are going to take for your prep.

34:38
So you know, just for paying the difference.

34:40
You do not even require 30 days.

34:42
You are going to have the scores captured within the within the you know algorithm.

34:47
You are going to put your you know time commitments accordingly.

34:50
You are going to have a fair estimate what exactly or how many hours you are going to take exactly to get to what kind of scores.

34:59
Another thing is some yeah, please go ahead.

35:03
Yeah, yeah, go ahead Nikita.

35:05
Yeah.

35:06
So all these practice questions, those that are provided on your platform, Amrit, are these designs specifically by e GMAT or do you also refer this OG that is provided by GMAC?

35:21
You are asking about the question quality or just just to be clear, the, the level and the, the difficulty.

35:30
See that is see see the difficulty level.

35:32
See one thing which is very, very particular is the course in itself.

35:36
The easy mat platform is built on top of the quality of questions.

35:40
So any, any program for the GMAT, a platform has to be built in terms of the quality of questions that has to be there and it has to resonate exactly with what you would find in your GMAT.

35:52
If you look at say hard questions, easy questions, medium questions, a medium question should be of medium difficulty level of your GMAT and hard questions.

35:59
And see these questions are also designed by, you know, people only, right?

36:02
So the within EZMAT you would find if you just check the GMAT club, you would realise that that the within the top 5 instructors out there, you would find 3 people or the top 3 instructors rated in GMAT club are from EZMAT.

36:18
So, you know, the quality of questions that we make and and give are really close to your, you know, the the actual thing.

36:25
And that is one of the reasons why most of the students that did see within our platform, most of the people who have got 695685.

36:33
Can you just see here all the people, all the people who just checkout their videos, their difference in scores from their actual final mock within our platform.

36:43
And the actual test is plus or -10 that that kind of accuracy is possible because of the quality of questions which is in place and the algorithm which, you know, generates this adaptive questions.

36:54
So is that your question Nikita?

36:56
Just just checking.

36:59
Yeah, yeah, I, I just wanted to check if the these are specifically designed by EG MAT or the its a mixture of EG MAT questions and what questions are over there in, in the official guide.

37:14
No, the, the these are specifically designed by by us.

37:18
But here you can still find medium cementing OG quizzes.

37:21
Can you see this?

37:23
Yeah, you can see medium cementing OG quizzes.

37:25
So wherever it is OG quizzes, we are going to mention that these are OG quizzes.

37:29
But this Caltranium is where we actually have built or you know, we have created our own questions and that requires a lot of R&D.

37:36
It's it's not that you know, we simply create questions and creating quality questions is really difficult.

37:42
So you know and that's why you see for GMAT the question pool, the quality question pools in the market in itself is very less so.

37:51
So wherever it is OG you are gonna find it as OG quiz mentioned here, hard, hard OG quizzes or medium OG quizzes, you are gonna particularly see that as OG quizzes.

38:01
But it is not interlinked with the actual database.

38:05
So those are different questions.

38:06
So this would be different.

38:07
What is the significance of that OG word that does it mean they are direct from the GMAT question bank or see they are very tough or what?

38:15
See OG question banks are generally the questions which see when, when they create a question bank every, every, you know, they, they also do their R and they, they also create questions every year.

38:27
They, you know, create, you know, you know, at least around, you know, 1000 to 2000 questions.

38:33
The GMAC, GMAC, GMAC, yeah.

38:36
So they also create around 1000 to 2000 questions.

38:39
And every year they would use a certain portion of the questions for their actual GMAC test and they are actually going to keep the remaining questions which is there as O GS.

38:50
So by default O GS are also a good quality questions.

38:54
And the questions which they have doubt for for instance, O GS are generally made of a question bank which they put out in public to understand the difficulty level.

39:04
So they would categorise wherever they have doubt regarding particular set of questions regarding the difficulty level, they would put out an OG based on their understanding.

39:11
So they get feedback from the experts the the the prep providers and all these things like from e GMAT, they are going to get a feedback in terms of how the questions are laid out.

39:20
Is that question marked as medium is actually difficult.

39:23
So they are going to get that feedback as well from the public because the GMAT questions in itself will not be revealed like they will not.

39:31
So that is why you would see maybe a score analysis or an ESR report will come, but you would never see the questions again.

39:38
So like the question back that you are going to see in your test.

39:42
So that is why even in the test centre once you complete the test, you are never going to see those particular quizzes which you have attempt your questions you have attempted, you are never going to see that again.

39:52
OK, The reason is that so so OG questions are good enough but always some students make a mistake by purchasing OG in the starting and try to learn from OG.

40:03
That is a very wrong approach because OG is not designed for your learning.

40:07
It is.

40:08
It is just.

40:09
A set of question banks that you can practice towards the end of your prep.

40:12
Suppose if Manimesh or Nikita, what if even if you still want to purchase OG quizzes or you know OG question bank, 4 books are available if you would like to purchase it.

40:23
And if if you want to purchase it, you have to purchase and use it as a question bank to solve questions.

40:28
Because the instructions are the you know step by step approach which they mentioned there to solve.

40:32
And all these things are not very clear.

40:34
It is not you know designed for learning.

40:37
It is for you to just have a practice so you can purchase them.

40:42
You can purchase them if you if you are looking at 23:24 OG quiz even I have the PDF versions within me and my system also.

40:49
So if if you had required, I can share you that maybe you can look into that because you you anyways, your test is gonna be on screen, right?

40:57
Not necessarily you should purchase a book.

41:00
So yeah.

41:02
So I can send you the PDF version of 2324 and after looking at that, after solving that, you can even look for 2425 question bank if you require you can purchase.

41:12
So not necessarily jump on investments.

41:16
Yeah, OK.

41:17
Another thing is let's say I will say my target score is 685, but let's say I I want to go beyond that.

41:25
So I hope it's not very it will not be cement concreted that no you you said 680 5:00 in the starting and that's what we are going to target now.

41:36
Never, never, never don't even worry about that.

41:40
Because see one thing is very clear.

41:43
If you give a certain 27 hours of time commitment and within 27 hours of time commitment that you have, you are starting from first of Jan, you are at a 325, you have to take 685, you are going to take at least 20, you are going to take around 25 of April.

41:59
So listen to have plus or -3 to say plus or minus a week.

42:03
It can be +2020 5 + 1 week or 25 -, 1 week.

42:08
That's how your preparation, you know would differ because of the human factors and other factors involved.

42:13
But the key factor is we don't drift it and even even see if you if you get a 685, you purchase a course for say 6 months.

42:21
Within 4 months, you reach a 685.

42:23
Of course you should have this score for still improving it to 735, right?

42:27
Hypothetically, what a scenario comes in where you get more time.

42:30
Your work became a bit easy.

42:31
You are able to give more time and you are able to finish it and you should have that leverage to improve.

42:36
So of course we would be happy to assist you if if you want to go for that.

42:40
And even we recommend students.

42:41
Suppose if a student actually has to apply only on the the September month or you know the deadline is on September, the student actually gave the test or or is ready by February itself for a 685.

42:54
We recommend them that, you know, lets push for one more month and do it in March and make sure that we get A725735.

43:02
And that's why you would see most of the students, if you see you can actually reach out to them in LinkedIn, you would see the people with 725, at least 70% of the people who have got 7725.

43:13
Even one of the students got 765.

43:16
They eventually gave up when they had 685695.

43:19
They in a way halfway they gave up that OK, I, I, I think I have, I am ready for it.

43:25
We ourselves have pushed them that, you know, they have time they can improve and you know, get to that.

43:30
So we ourself would push people for that.

43:32
And of course, if you yourself want to improve, why would we stop?

43:39
And there is this example that you took, right like of 224 score, you have to like distribute it like 8452, right?

43:50
252 be very clear.

43:54
So 252 is what you have to chase 224 would put you in that 30th percentile or 20th percentile will be somewhere around 4 hundreds or in the starting 500.

44:03
So yeah, 252 is your score.

44:04
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:05
Amrit.

44:05
So another thing is how is this like 252?

44:09
Then it's it will get scaled to what, 785685?

44:13
So how is this transition happening?

44:16
Can you explain that also?

44:18
OK, so see the all the things you cannot find anywhere.

44:21
I'm just telling you, maybe you can take a note, see a score of 246 that is 828282 for for easy understanding.

44:29
I am just telling you a score of 8282 for easy understanding.

44:33
You just think of this 82 on an average if you are getting that is added up to 246, right?

44:39
Can you just add 80 to 8082?

44:41
Its 246 right.

44:42
So a 246 or 828282 on average is gonna give you 645.

44:47
Just take a note.

44:49
I mean is just by default it is like that, is it?

44:52
It is default.

44:53
So for you to understand or for when you are targeting a different score, how this combination works?

44:57
How do I know that say 246 is 645 and you know how do I know that 252 is 685 and how do I know that 255 is going to be 705?

45:08
How do I know that?

45:09
I am just giving you that insight.

45:11
If you would like to do it yourself or understand yourself.

45:13
One thing is as standard you can think of is the 246.

45:18
A score of 246 that is 82 on an average is going to give you a score of 645.

45:23
OK 645 is around 89th percentile is what you are going to get and that 645 is equivalent to 7 hundredths in the classic.

45:31
So most of the schools which say 700 is their threshold that that is equivalent to 645 in classic.

45:37
So basically lets lets not complicate things but just just to make it clear, 82 on an average is going to give you you know 6 4583 on an average is gonna give you 66584 on an average is gonna give you 685 and 85 on an average is gonna give you 705.

45:58
So you see the pattern every average as your average increases by one in 828282838383, you're gonna see 20 point difference from 245 like from 645 to 665 to 685 to 705 to 725.

46:15
You're gonna see the difference, right?

46:17
You know, so that 20 point difference comes from your scores getting, you know, you know, 828282 then 838383 is 20, another 20 point difference you're gonna see with 848484 you're gonna see another 20 point difference.

46:33
So that's how your scoring is gonna be.

46:35
So if you look at this particular scenario, 685 you, if you if you just add the target scores of verbal content DI 85 plus 86 + 8181.

46:49
So this is 252.

46:51
If you just add 85 + 86 + 81, it is 252.

46:55
If you do 252 / 3, it's 84.

46:59
Yeah.

47:00
So that's what I was telling.

47:01
So that 848484 is coming because that 41 improvement.

47:06
So whichever target you have, how much percent is 9696 percentile 685 is 96 percentile original GMAT.

47:12
How much that will be in original GMAT you can do a plus 55 or plus 60.

47:19
So it will be somewhere around 1160 around.

47:23
So it will be around if if you look at plus 55 in itself or plus 60 in itself, it is going to be around 74750.

47:32
And is there any minimum number that we have to achieve in each section?

47:36
No, there is no sectional cut off.

47:37
So that is a beauty even if you want to hit that, you know, that's what I was telling the combination score matters.

47:43
If it is 252, you can actually have 1990 in both.

47:48
So it's 180 already.

47:49
So remaining you have to get 62, right?

47:54
You can get even 62 and get a 242.

47:57
Like if it is 252, you have to get a 72 here.

48:00
So 1990 in each and 72 in data incest, which is actually less.

48:04
72 in data incest would be somewhere around, you know, 30th percentile that is actually less, but there is no sectional cut off does not matter.

48:12
OK, yeah, OK, OK.

48:17
Another thing is do you have any program like score guarantee like this guy Princeton Review and all those people have do you have something?

48:24
Yeah, see even Princeton Review has TDB has Prince and review to an extent has and TDB also mentions in the website.

48:31
But see one thing which is very clear is its its it's a gimmick to be to be precise.

48:38
I will tell you why you can just go and see by yourself.

48:42
In most of the cases what is mentioned is lot of terms and conditions comes with, you know, score guarantee.

48:47
We can also provide the first thing mostly what they say is you have to have a valid GMAT score, not a mock score, not a, you know, not from their portal or not their thing.

48:57
They want a valid GMAT score to start show as a starting point and within that.

49:04
So your score guarantee would be based on your starting score and to get it avail, they will say that you have to hit that particular percentile.

49:12
Suppose if you look at here, they would say that you have to hit those particular percentiles or threshold consistently or to make sure that each if if, if we hypothetically say that here in every course you have to get grade A if you get any of the less than grade A, you will not be availed.

49:28
So how does it make sense because maybe there is also possibility that we had a bad day or something while preparing.

49:33
Maybe we would come back and see.

49:35
But still you, you may not do well, but this is actually a good score.

49:39
Like if you consider getting grade and maybe one grade A minus is perfectly fine.

49:43
But for giving conditions, they can give or we can even give a condition that it should be all grade A in throughout the course, you should be getting completely grade A so, so that by default you are going to be in that 70th percent as you finish it.

49:55
And from that going it is easy.

49:56
So we can put out an ideal situation in which you are bound to get that and then you know if that is not getting we can give you.

50:04
So it is like you know tossing a coin and and you know you know 100 times and saying that if if you don't get tails even one time we are going to give you a refund.

50:14
So you know you just have to think about it.

50:16
So, so those are claims just to attract.

50:21
If you just look at the terms and conditions carefully, you would realise that of course, would you, would you actually pay for a GMAT course right now and take it and, and then come back to them?

50:31
Because that in itself is gonna cost you like a course, right?

50:34
GMAT test in India, if you take, you're gonna have around 25,027, 1000 with, with, with taxes and all these things, you're gonna pay 27,000.

50:43
So are you actually gonna pay 27,000 and take the actual test and then come with a score to them and then you're gonna improve?

50:49
Is that the case?

50:51
So, so you have to think about all this grounds and when when it comes to the score guarantee most of them would would recommend if you just go detail, you are going to see that they want a GMAT, actual GMAT score, not any of the mocks.

51:03
They will not consider mocks at all.

51:05
So you have to have a GMAT score in place and then followed by the conditions that you have to do do these, these, these things and you have to ensure that you are hitting those only then they give you.

51:15
So why to get into all those things when actually, you know, we don't you know, we don't believe in doing all those things.

51:22
We say that see, if you do our course, we have proofs out there.

51:26
Now see if if it just each of the each of the platforms that you see, everybody has YouTube channel, all the test providers.

51:32
You just have to check their name.

51:33
Everybody has their channel.

51:34
Just look at the success stories that they have posted in the last one month.

51:38
Just check the number of people who got maybe if your target is 685, just see how many 685 has been posted in the last one month.

51:47
Check the do the counting as simple as that you would get your answer.

51:52
And these are not just if you just see all this is just not testimonial video 5 minute or 2 minutes saying that Ezimat is the best.

51:59
No, we have this 25 minute video, 35 minute video, 2930 minutes.

52:04
So all this way places where we are gonna discuss strategies as well.

52:07
Of course they studied with us.

52:09
That is one thing.

52:09
But we are not gonna you know, you know ask them to do a video saying that you studied with us and that is why you improve.

52:16
We generally ask them in terms of how their strategy has been, what are the things that they realised during their prep that they went wrong and what are the corrections that they made so that that can help students.

52:24
Even if you are someone who has not purchased our course, seeing this video should help you understand in terms of the those common strategies because you know, for each of the students, the challenges that face would be different.

52:34
There is not a one stop solution.

52:36
That's what we believe in.

52:37
That's why we create this custom study plan, custom course for each of the individual, for  and Nikita, for each of you, it's going to be a completely different journey in terms of your prep based on your strength, based on your weakness.

52:48
So you are going to have a different, even if both of you suppose ideally you both take a test today and each of you scored a 555, but the course duration in itself is going to be different for each of you because your percentiles in each of the scores and other elements that would come into play within bubble.

53:05
Also you have to see the CR percentile, RC percentile, all these things, your time commitment, lot of factors would account to and create a plan which is completely different for you than compared to the other person.

53:16
So it is like a fingerprint.

53:18
So that is that is the only way.

53:20
A general course may help to an action but might not take you to that particular high score.

53:26
Any general course can eventually take you to A625635 beat any course.

53:30
I am not telling easy matter.

53:32
Any course after a point can help you reach 625635.

53:37
That is not the big game.

53:38
The game is from going from that 635 to 685 or 705 or even 735 which is 100 percentile.

53:44
That is the big game.

53:46
So that's the challenge.

53:51
OK yeah.

53:52
So basically that's a gimmick kind of thing.

53:55
And yeah it is, it is clearly gimmick.

53:57
You just have to go and look at the terms and condition.

53:59
You realise if if you don't have to take take my things to face value, you just have to do it yourself.

54:05
You have to realise that that's what they do.

54:07
So yeah, yeah, I have seen that they put the star Mark and they say either 70 point improvement or that thing.

54:14
I've seen that.

54:15
I just, I wanted to confirm key.

54:17
Do you have that any kind of program something like that?

54:20
But that's no, no, no, no, no.

54:21
OK, especially that is not gonna even help you because you're just starting your preparation, right?

54:26
So that's never gonna help you either in, in any of the platform.

54:29
It's not gonna matter to you.

54:30
Because you see, generally if you are someone who's repeating after taking the test, maybe you already have a GMAT score.

54:36
In that case, you know, at least you would fall under that condition, you know, or if you at least you have an option that you get grade as and you know, avail that if it is not happening.

54:46
But you know, in in your case though, it is completely absurd, right?

54:50
You you cannot take a test for it.

54:53
Yeah.

54:53
Yeah.

54:54
So the so one other question is about the teachers.

54:57
Who are the teachers?

54:58
Like can you who is going to teach?

55:02
Like there will be mentors and they are going to be teachers, right.

55:05
See our course are interactive video lessons in in in our case our course all are recorded sessions.

55:11
That is why it is self based.

55:13
We don't go in batches like 7 to 8:00 PM or 7 to 9:00 PM.

55:16
We don't have that batches running.

55:18
And all the videos that you see here are majorly from you know, Kanupriya, which is top rated expert subject expert, you are going to have from Payal Rajat among the top 5, you know, subject experts or teachers in GMAT globally ranked.

55:37
And so of course Fire and Rajat would be covering the major aspect of your prep.

55:43
But you will also have videos sessions from other mentors.

55:47
So in terms of video lessons, it is going to be interactive lessons, interactive in the sense you start a video and within the video itself, you will have a lot of questions that follows up and based on your questions, your video might extend.

55:59
Maybe a video can be the same video if you animation Nikita you are taking based on your feedbacks and how you answer them.

56:07
Video can be 15 minute, also a 20 minute video also depending upon the length depends upon how you respond to it.

56:13
So that's why we call it interactive video lesson.

56:14
And that's not the quiz.

56:15
You would have a quiz to test your understanding.

56:18
How much of it have you actually absorbed?

56:20
You're going to have that that is separate towards the end of it.

56:23
But within the video itself, you're going to have some quizzes and all the things where you can learn and you know accordingly or you know the the course would adjust itself.

56:31
It's like, you know, we have this story mode kind of thing based on our choice.

56:36
It will navigate so in a way its like that for most of the videos and some videos are there, which is like a 10 minute video, 5 minute videos, which is quickly telling you are covering concepts.

56:46
Those is gonna those those videos are gonna be a very you know, straight forward videos, which will it will not be interactive.

56:51
It will be a recorded video that you are gonna run through.

56:55
So, so that, that is how it is.

56:57
And yeah, Nikita hard for for the duration of the course, right, For the number of hours of the course, No, generally you, you can see your estimate here.

57:12
There is an estimated course duration which is an average for completing critical reasoning.

57:16
You have 30 hours to complete to complete your master comprehension.

57:21
You are going to have some, if you take master comprehension, it is, it is going to take around 7 hours, 24 minutes.

57:27
It can take 8 hours for some people.

57:28
It can be 7 hours for some people.

57:30
So, you know, plus or -30 minutes is is gonna happen.

57:33
So that's why we call it estimated post duration.

57:35
So if we have a plain recorded session, maybe it can be even lesser.

57:39
But in this case though, depending, depending upon the scenario, it might differ.

57:44
So that's why this estimated post duration is there.

57:47
And yeah, OK, so the mentors will be different and teachers will be different, right?

57:54
Yeah, both would be different.

57:56
And you know, if if you have and you know, see of course you would have its like a YouTube video where each of the lessons would have a doubt session where ask an expert session would be there where your queries would be addressed.

58:07
But still, if it is not very clear, you just have to ping your mentor.

58:12
Your mentor would Even so in in the the video which I am going to send you regarding mentor, you would see that your mentor would even request or you know get a video pertaining to a doubt be recorded by your subject expert and share it to you.

58:25
So that also happens if for a particular file, if the communication or the doubt is not cleared, you are still stuck at it or you need a conceptual clarity for the your you know most most probably pile even even pile records or or you know Rajit also records and send your pertaining to a particular doubt.

58:44
They record 10 minute video, 15 minute video explaining you that particular doubt.

58:48
So first thing they might ask you is maybe you have to send a voice or something which clearly tells not in touch, but clearly tells them or and you know, make them understand what exactly is your doubt.

58:58
And accordingly, they will create a video and send it to you for you to, you know, view it and access it.

59:03
So that that is one thing.

59:06
So these mentors are going to be there just to plan or preparation, right?

59:12
They are not there to not just planning see you know like so during initial series they are there see they you will have their direct inbox to your mentors.

59:21
You're gonna communicate it's like the old Facebook Messenger you see right you're gonna have the direct inbox to your mentor which you're gonna connect and discuss.

59:28
So initially in terms of strategy, there is nothing much that they will be doing.

59:32
They are just they are just gonna be a guiding force.

59:36
But the game changes when you when you reach a 635 beyond that point.

59:41
See all the data that you capture here.

59:42
You will have a dashboard here when you're going to go and take this test.

59:45
But these are not just the dashboards.

59:47
Your mentor would be creating a profile for you from the day you start.

59:51
You are you are going to have a profile built by a mentor.

59:54
So once you reach a 635, then you are going to get into a teams call with your mentor at a regular interval, may be once in a day or once in 2 days.

1:00:02
You are going to have that connect with your mentor in detail to actually understand or or to strategise and give you that corrective factors in terms of how to improve your time in those particular questions and what is exactly so like the way if you know.

1:00:16
We have a cricket team of analysts, right, For every, every top cricket teams.

1:00:20
Now we have analysts coming into play to help the players understand what's his strength, what's his weakness and how to how to navigate things, how to improve with the help of coach.

1:00:28
So mentors are basically a coach with a high analytic support or analytics behind it to give you that instructive feedbacks.

1:00:38
OK.

1:00:38
And so we will be collecting Yeah, yeah, I was saying for now for actual doubt resolution, we have to reach out to the teachers directly.

1:00:52
No, you you have to see one thing is you can reach out to your tutors directly through the section doubt clearing sessions that you would see under each video lessons.

1:01:02
You are going to have that.

1:01:03
But beyond that, if you want to personally reach out like like want them to record a video for you and and have to clear it right away for pertaining to a particular topics, you can navigate through your mentor.

1:01:17
Your mentor is actually going to help you facilitate it.

1:01:20
OK, OK, understood.

1:01:23
So this mentor will be connected only through this your channel Egmat channel or its going to connect it through WhatsApp as well?

1:01:32
No, initially it will be through Egmat channel.

1:01:34
So see the, the main scenario is different.

1:01:38
See till the time you reach like the way I always say till you reach that 85th percentile capability, the instructions are going to be very clear and straightforward that what exactly has to be done you are going to have.

1:01:50
So once, once I share you a video like the way I said once I share you that video and to go through it yet have a clear clarity.

1:01:55
But I am still telling giving an overview that initially it is very straightforward in terms of your instruction and things are going to be very clear in terms of what activities has to be done wherever your feedback is required, chat support is enough.

1:02:07
But later on once once you reach that last mail, so we enroll UNLA program called last Mail push that is also free of cost.

1:02:14
You are not going to be charged for that.

1:02:15
It is inclusive within the course.

1:02:17
So what happens there is when you reach that capability, it becomes bit of tricky even for us to explain things over chat.

1:02:25
It is not possible that we explain everything through chat and the communication has to be more efficient and we involve you in a Teams call.

1:02:33
And at that point of time of course maybe you would reach get get the connect with your mentor in WhatsApp and all these things you start that would be the last leg of your breath.

1:02:41
Maybe last one month or one and half months it is going to be but initially we don't do that because of course the bandwidth is also there.

1:02:47
They have to support you know, you know you and and give you that right guidance.

1:02:51
So of course you know, initially, sorry, not through WhatsApp.

1:02:58
So not initially initially, initially not through WhatsApp.

1:03:00
Yeah, OK.

1:03:03
So once he once you reach that 64563555 yeah, then then we'll be connected through WhatsApp.

1:03:10
Yeah yeah, mostly 635 some cases 625.

1:03:13
Also we we, we generally once you reach around 85th percentile, we ourselves would enroll you in last mile much program that would change the dynamics.

1:03:20
So that's what is required for you to go from that 625 to 7 or 5 to 25.

1:03:25
So soon after this call, I'm going to send you a video which is actually going to clear your doubts regarding what is mentor.

1:03:31
What does the mentor do for you?

1:03:32
You're going to have that clear instructions there.

1:03:34
OK so another thing is on GMAT club or somewhere I was reading the one of guy was posted some good reviews about E GMAT that he needed more help because he had very less time to prepare and one of the Co founder had come and taught him.

1:03:54
So does that happen at the E GMAT or what?

1:03:58
See depending upon multiple scenarios, that's what I was telling one of the Co founder Payal like the way I said, I said none that they would record the session or they would come in directly.

1:04:07
So this is something which we don't promise as a part of course.

1:04:09
See when we start something, if you promise then it has to be delivered right?

1:04:13
So if you promise it that you know the founders are going to help you and they are going to do that thing may not happen depending upon your situation and your genuinity towards your prep.

1:04:23
Maybe it is not that from day one the student actually had come by, maybe for a particular scenario they would have come.

1:04:28
So based on the situation and what makes more sense we would do it for our students.

1:04:33
So generally we do that lot of things beyond the scope of what we commit.

1:04:38
We do that, but that is not something which we mentioned in our in the starting discussion itself.

1:04:43
So that, you know, if you set that expectation then you would purchase just for that, right?

1:04:47
You would be purchasing your, making your we would be influencing your purchase decision just based on that.

1:04:52
And if that is not happening, then you would be, you know, disappointed as well.

1:04:56
If maybe a situation arises where we feel that that's not required and we don't do it, but you feel it's required and then you think that I purchased for this and I didn't get it.

1:05:05
So we don't want that confusion to happen.

1:05:06
But of course, one thing you can be very assured about this, whatever or to whatever extent we need to go to get to your target score, they would be doing it.

1:05:17
So our goal is if, if you have to go for 4 months and we have to hit that score, whatever extent that we need to go, we, we are going to do that and make you, you know, reach that score.

1:05:26
Provided you are also getting that kind of commitments.

1:05:29
We would see right, based on your scores, how, how much time you spend in our platform, even every, every minute you spend in our platform, we are going to see that how many minutes to an extent of how many minutes and how many seconds you are spending our platform, We are going to get that clarity.

1:05:42
So a lot of factors would account for and for us to create a decision or, you know, make a decision in terms of what kind of support to be done.

1:05:49
If you are legitimate, you, you are really see the student and you need some help, of course we will be there.

1:05:54
So, so, so that's, that's the idea.

1:05:58
OK.

1:05:59
Another thing is, so this is about GMAT.

1:06:02
So yeah, regarding the admission support, do you have anything like that?

1:06:08
Lets say this is GMAT.

1:06:10
I got some fantastic, fantastic score.

1:06:12
But after that we have any support for the admission like we would guide, we would guide and help you understand a lot of things.

1:06:19
Again, see our our platform in itself is a GMAT platform, GMAT prep platform and our focus is strictly towards that.

1:06:27
See even even most of the other providers also charge extra for your you know other support and all this things.

1:06:34
But we are not into that services yet like we are.

1:06:37
We were we are very clear that our focus is to get people, our students to a particular target score and then get it by.

1:06:43
But couple of things that you can expect is the students who may be your targets school may not be the first school, right?

1:06:51
We would have already had students who have already joined there.

1:06:53
Maybe we can give you the not the contact number, but the contact details like LinkedIn and other platforms where you can reach out to them and check with them.

1:07:01
So the alums kind of thing.

1:07:03
We can you know help you out.

1:07:06
So you know all those things would be there towards the end of this.

1:07:09
You know we are pre once you have a score of course we will be helping you in all those terms, but not with their essays not with their application.

1:07:15
Technically we will not be sitting with you.

1:07:17
So like the way we commit for GMAT, we don't have anything that we have.

1:07:21
We would commit and do it for your, you know, preparation.

1:07:26
You would have to look it on your own.

1:07:28
But of course you whatever queries you have, you know, regarding where to approach, how to do it, how to do this, all these things, you are going to get clear instructions.

1:07:37
Your support is, you know, you can expect a support or guidance, but not a service.

1:07:44
OK, OK, no problem.

1:07:46
Yeah.

1:07:46
OK.

1:07:46
So maybe the last leg of the question like do you have yeah, referral kind of thing like do you have any insider coupon that can reduce the priced not, not a referral coupon.

1:08:02
See, see, we generally see most of the cases.

1:08:04
I will tell you one thing very honestly 65% of the calls that gets booked majorly are through either either no our students generally the remaining 45 would come from our people seeing our GMAT club reviews and all this things would come to many 45%.

1:08:20
But to be honest, I am telling you more than 50%, around 60%, 55% to 60% of the crowd are coming through either one of our old EEZ math students referring through or the existing students referring through.

1:08:33
So we don't have a referral bonus as such.

1:08:39
But yeah.

1:08:40
So if if there are a couple of peoples who start together in in that case we generally give an extension.

1:08:46
So that's what we generally give best maybe a 15 days section from both of the students.

1:08:51
Like if if you if either of you are starting may be one day, 2 day prior difference is also fine.

1:08:56
But if there is a considerable difference in your case Nikita, you still want a time to think over it and come back.

1:09:02
So in that case that may not be applicable.

1:09:04
But yeah, generally you know, if if both of the people are planning to purchase together may be in one or 2 days time here and there that that is OK.

1:09:13
We would give a 15 days extension worth of $49 you are going to get.

1:09:21
OK, yeah.

1:09:24
So the final price will be one 59159.

1:09:27
If you know after 30 days like the way we discuss, you can pay the difference and you know get 4 months or 6 months.

1:09:36
OK, OK, so I will drop you the mail regarding the same.

1:09:39
I have added you in the mail thread.

1:09:43
Yeah, maybe today only I'll make the purchase and we'll start from.

1:09:46
So are you one of the mentors to.

1:09:48
No, no, I'm.

1:09:49
I'm not a mentor.

1:09:50
So I'm just there to give you a very clear idea on what you are purchasing and to give you a whole insight in terms of, you know, clear the queries before you get in.

1:09:58
So my role is limited to that.

1:10:00
So we have experts out there as mentors who would actually do the job for you.

1:10:05
So my role is just to give an idea of what you are getting into.

1:10:09
OK.

1:10:09
And another thing, so before assigning the mentor, do you give us the list of mentors and then we have to select or is just going to be random?

1:10:19
Not random.

1:10:20
See, So what we are going to do is you know, we, you're going to send a mail.

1:10:25
I will help you with the format.

1:10:26
You're going to send a mail once you make the purchase from that registered mail ID, you're going to send a mail mentioning about your profile in terms of, you know, you may be a tech, you know, education background.

1:10:37
And you can also mention about you starting your prep.

1:10:41
You have not, you know, taken any mock.

1:10:43
So you can mention that and you can also give your, you know, time duration, how many hours in a week you can prepare all these things and your target score, your targets.

1:10:51
Cool.

1:10:52
You can mention all those things and your deadline also, you're gonna mention it and you're gonna request a mentor.

1:10:56
So that's gonna go to that support mail support at the rate it is gmail.com from the support team, that mail would actually go to the, you know, mentors page.

1:11:05
So from there whichever mentor suits your profile and has the bandwidth would be registered.

1:11:11
So it is not ran its its based on us deciding you know who would be the best person for you, we would be assigning them.

1:11:17
So that is how it happens.

1:11:20
OK, Yeah, yeah.

1:11:23
One last question out of curiosity.

1:11:26
So now while going through the website, we saw this tall claims that that are over there on E GMAT where you have compared E GMAT with other GMAT platforms, GMAT preparation platforms.

1:11:37
Yeah, for how, how exactly do you validate these this data, see these to be honest, these data are in public.

1:11:45
If you look at the you know, what exact claims are you looking for that result, right?

1:11:51
The, you know, 3 times the result that you would see all the things, right, right, right.

1:11:57
Yeah, All these data are in public.

1:11:59
All these data are in public in, in GMAT reviews and you know, all the platforms and even that that is one of the examples.

1:12:05
As I said, you can look at all the test providers, their YouTube channels as well.

1:12:10
You know, in terms of every, every, every, you know, you know, the top test providers have this channel and they would post videos as well as on occurrence.

1:12:20
So you just see the number of, you know, outputs or reviews coming by and the results coming by and you yourself would know the difference.

1:12:27
And GMAT Club is not a place where you can do a PR because maybe in Google you can put reviews, you can, you know, do a PR and get your ratings up.

1:12:36
But GMAT Club you can actually get put your reviews and you have to be verified to get that, you know, to public.

1:12:44
