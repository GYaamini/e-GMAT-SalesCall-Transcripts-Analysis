0:19
Bit sick, but yeah, thanks to you.
Speaker: prospect

0:22
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

0:23
So , you know I saw your message.
Speaker: agent

0:27
So you are planning to take in 3 to 4 months, right?
Speaker: agent

0:32
Ji Mad.
Speaker: prospect

0:32
So OK, so let me tell you I am planning to go for an executive MBA that is a full time MBA that is in I am Ahmedabad OK.
Speaker: prospect

0:42
And for that I read that requirements it was mentioned that it was only accepting the GMAT that you have given on the at the test center OK OK.
Speaker: prospect

0:54
And my target for giving that GMAT is within 34 months.
Speaker: prospect

1:00
OK, understood.
Speaker: agent

1:04
So for this call is majorly for you to understand or for you to ask queries regarding the e GMAT platform and how it is or you know any questions related to a GMAT feel free to open.
Speaker: agent

1:16
We don't go by the agenda or a presentation mode.
Speaker: agent

1:19
It is just that we do it candidate the candidate wave based on whatever you would like to ask and yeah, we can do that.
Speaker: agent

1:25
How did you hear about us anyway?
Speaker: agent

1:27
Yeah, I search on the GMAT classes and E GMAT what is the name coming up?
Speaker: prospect

1:33
So I tried OK, so OK, so you got it from YouTube, is it?
Speaker: agent

1:41
No, no, I saw it on Google GMAT, GMAT lashes so and your g your company name came up.
Speaker: prospect

1:48
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

1:50
So OK, So what are your questions?
Speaker: agent

1:52
So this session you have booked for clearing your queries.
Speaker: agent

1:56
So what are your questions?
Speaker: agent

1:58
I told you my requirements and so then how you can help me out for regarding the thing.
Speaker: prospect

2:05
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

2:05
See, you know, your target should be somewhere around, you know, 665 to 675.
Speaker: agent

2:13
You know, the Classic edition.
Speaker: agent

2:14
Earlier we had something called Classic Edition.
Speaker: agent

2:16
Classic Edition was a test which has stopped from to the 22,023.
Speaker: agent

2:20
But if you just Google the score requirement, you would see 700 plus.
Speaker: agent

2:24
But 700 plus is a remark of Classic Edition.
Speaker: agent

2:27
Now the test has changed.
Speaker: agent

2:29
Focus Edition is a bit more tougher so 645 in focus is equal into 700 earlier.
Speaker: agent

2:34
So in your case you have to look for A665675 which is around 95th percentile is what you need to chase for.
Speaker: agent

2:43
I am Ahmedabad executive MBA Yeah yeah to if you have to maximise your chances, the save score, you can still get through with the 6645 also, but to higher your chances and especially because you have 3 to 4 months of time, 675 would be a great, you know, score to actually apply with.
Speaker: agent

3:07
OK, so how is your syllabus and training and all Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

3:12
So you have a very defined syllabus for GMAT.
Speaker: agent

3:16
If you if you look at let me just share my screen.
Speaker: agent

3:25
If you just see we have verbal quants and data insights, 3 sections, 45 minutes each.
Speaker: agent

3:32
Verbal has 23 questions, Quant has 21 questions and data insights has 20 questions.
Speaker: agent

3:37
So that is how the structure is for 45 minutes each.
Speaker: agent

3:39
And within verbal you have mainly 2 sections.
Speaker: agent

3:42
That is critical distance and reading comprehension.
Speaker: agent

3:44
These are the 2 sections that you want to find in verbal.
Speaker: agent

3:47
And in our case, we cover from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

3:51
That is why you see master comprehensive.
Speaker: agent

3:52
It is going to help you cover from the fundamental so that yeah, you do not need a brush up before you take the course because we only do your brush up in terms of your you know you don't have to actually waste your time doing brush up before during the course because we come from the fundamentals in coins.
Speaker: agent

4:08
Also we have arithmetic in the algebra.
Speaker: agent

4:10
Arithmetic is divided into number of properties, word problems and advanced topics and algebra is there.
Speaker: agent

4:17
Then we start with quant basics here also.
Speaker: agent

4:20
So all are interactive video lessons that you are going to go through with each, you know, lessons you are going to have a quiz towards and to understand how much have you actually absorbed.
Speaker: agent

4:30
For example, if we teach you say 1 + 7 is 8, we would ask you 3 + 9.
Speaker: agent

4:36
So you know you should know how to apply their learnings rather than just you know, doing the same question.
Speaker: agent

4:42
So the quiz is like an application based model which will understand or give you an idea how much have you actually absorbed.
Speaker: agent

4:50
So free material also in your website, GEG math, some courses and tutorial correct free country.
Speaker: prospect

4:56
You have a free trial randomly taken couple of files from essential quant.
Speaker: agent

5:03
So that is just for you to understand how we teach you.
Speaker: agent

5:06
You just have to just checkout those videos, which should clearly indicate you that how, how how do we teach?
Speaker: agent

5:11
If you are comfortable with it, you can actually go for the purchase of the course.
Speaker: agent

5:16
that's how it is.
Speaker: prospect

5:16
So there is no live classes.
Speaker: prospect

5:21
We can go for live classes, but we what we recommend is first start with see life classes can be anytime be an add on like $49 can be an add on for any of the month and choose life class.
Speaker: agent

5:35
No need to purchase from the beginning, but you can always go for life plus, you know self face course.
Speaker: agent

5:42
So if you would want to go for that, that would be it.
Speaker: agent

5:46
So life plus self face course is what we have.
Speaker: agent

5:49
But if you say to be honest, this classes itself is enough because if you are working professional, maybe you might not find the I mean.
Speaker: agent

5:59
So it will be batch wise session.
Speaker: prospect

6:01
It will not be one on one.
Speaker: prospect

6:02
It will not be batch wise.
Speaker: agent

6:04
It will be a batch wise session which might happen in a Standard Time.
Speaker: agent

6:08
So if you are not able to attend it evening mostly, it will be mostly evening 8:00 or 830.
Speaker: agent

6:13
It is when the so yeah.
Speaker: agent

6:19
So that that is when it is.
Speaker: agent

6:21
And even with the self based course also for students, we give some free webinars also you see here ace reading conversation and MSR on GMAT, ace arithmetic.
Speaker: agent

6:31
So when see you say 9:30 PM, you know PS T that is 11:00 AM IST on Sunday, Saturday it is 11:00 AM.
Speaker: agent

6:40
So Saturday, Sunday in the morning sessions.
Speaker: agent

6:43
So that's how that's how it is going to be.
Speaker: agent

6:48
So free, free sessions.
Speaker: agent

6:49
I am talking about the free sessions.
Speaker: agent

6:50
Even if you are selfish course without life, still you can have some webinars and all this instead.
Speaker: agent

6:55
But a live course would be where we would be taking topic wise a new batch shots every alternate Saturdays.
Speaker: agent

7:02
So you don't necessarily have to you know.
Speaker: agent

7:06
So every every session we make sure that we are not keeping continuity.
Speaker: agent

7:10
We finish a particular, take a topic particularly we finish and then go to the next.
Speaker: agent

7:14
So you don't have to worry that OK this session I didn't attempt the next session.
Speaker: agent

7:18
I should you know watch it you can attend and then watch it later.
Speaker: agent

7:22
Also because it will be different topics for different days.
Speaker: agent

7:26
What is the duration for that?
Speaker: prospect

7:30
For which one live class?
Speaker: agent

7:35
Live class would be around 2 hours of session is what you would be having top big wise.
Speaker: agent

7:40
So generally life classes are recommended for students who already have an understanding so that the questions discussed would be a high level questions.
Speaker: agent

7:47
So suppose initially you are just starting and you are not aware of the concepts you attend live class you would feel left out.
Speaker: agent

7:54
So that is why I was suggesting you to not go in the initial month itself may be from the second month or 3rd month you can pay $49 and then at it.
Speaker: agent

8:03
So by that you would have complete you know completed significant amount of portion.
Speaker: agent

8:07
So when you attend it, it is going to be productive for you.
Speaker: agent

8:11
In live classes they don't teach concepts they directly go to the question solving questions questions already.
Speaker: agent

8:17
Because live classes are designed for students who want to solve hard questions with the tutor.
Speaker: agent

8:22
So in live class you have to.
Speaker: agent

8:24
So for students maybe if who is already at a you know 5556 not 5 kind of score would generally purchase from day one itself.
Speaker: agent

8:32
But in your case if you are just starting by I think eventually you will regret.
Speaker: agent

8:37
So I don't want you to regret so that's why I am just telling you.
Speaker: agent

8:40
You can purchase up to 2 months where you cover signature promotion.
Speaker: agent

8:45
What?
Speaker: prospect

8:46
OK so you are telling me to go for self age course, recorded course?
Speaker: prospect

8:52
Yes go for self age course and then switch to live classes.
Speaker: agent

8:55
If you have the bandwidth you have to switch to live classes to solve hard level questions along with your tutor you can clear your doubts and all these things live classes.
Speaker: agent

9:04
So we can look into it and what about the mock test?
Speaker: prospect

9:11
You will have 5 full length adaptive mock test with the course.
Speaker: agent

9:15
So you will have 90 plus sectional mocks for verbal separate, coin separate and DA separate.
Speaker: agent

9:21
Then you will have subsectional mocks and custom quizzes as well.
Speaker: agent

9:24
Let me show you.
Speaker: agent

9:28
So if you look at say verbal verbal incept you have cementing quizzes, which is subsectional mocks around 9030 each for verbal content DA and then sectional mocks, then custom quizzes to do targeted learning.
Speaker: agent

9:40
Shall I send you 17 minute video which is very important regarding the mental support.
Speaker: agent

9:45
So I will I will talk about the mental support.
Speaker: agent

9:46
You will have some questions also very mental support.
Speaker: agent

9:49
But I would suggest you to watch the 7 minute video pause here and watch the 7 minute video.
Speaker: agent

9:54
Can you do that?
Speaker: agent

9:54
I will just sending you the link so that I I want to address your questions in this call itself.
Speaker: agent

10:02
So I will I will send you, you get pause watch that 7 minute video and then we will join back and discuss.
Speaker: agent

10:09
You can play it here only No, on your screen.
Speaker: prospect

10:10
So it is OK.
Speaker: agent

10:11
You cannot hear.
Speaker: agent

10:12
You cannot hear you.
Speaker: agent

10:14
You not get the audio.
Speaker: agent

10:16
That is the trouble.
Speaker: agent

10:18
OK, OK Theek.
Speaker: prospect

10:19
Yeah yeah.
Speaker: prospect

10:27
You are sending me the chat box.
Speaker: prospect

10:30
You want in chat box.
Speaker: agent

10:31
I can send in chat box.
Speaker: agent

10:32
I sent in WhatsApp chat box should be great.
Speaker: agent

10:35
Yeah, I will send it to you in chat box.
Speaker: agent

10:45
Got it.
Speaker: prospect

10:47
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

10:47
So I will just mute my just 7 minute.
Speaker: prospect

10:50
Yeah, it is a 7 minute video.
Speaker: agent

10:52
You can mute yourself and once it is done I will be here.
Speaker: agent

10:55
Only you can let me know.
Speaker: agent

10:57
OK, Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

17:08
Hello, yeah yeah I saw this with you.
Speaker: prospect

17:13
So let me do one thing.
Speaker: prospect

17:16
The amount that I will be going to pay that will include the mentor and that is also image of application mentor not a live phone one on one call.
Speaker: prospect

17:25
So mentorship happens in 2 phases.
Speaker: agent

17:27
Initially you would have this mentorship in chat and mail you this.
Speaker: agent

17:31
You see this chat window right?
Speaker: agent

17:32
Like the old Facebook Messenger, wherever you have doubt you are, ping them, they are going to get a pop up.
Speaker: agent

17:37
The response you are going to get a pop up if in case even if you are not in the platform, you are going to get a mail as well a notification so that you would be aware that OK, your mentor has responded.
Speaker: agent

17:46
That is one thing that is still you reach a score of 625.
Speaker: agent

17:51
So once you are at 6:25, you would be enrolled in a program called last mile push program LMP program that also is inclusive within the course you are not going to be charged.
Speaker: agent

18:01
So what happens in Last mile Push program is see the purpose of Last Mile Push program is if I consider 2 person person A and person B, person A with a score of 625 which is around 8 5th percentile and person B with the score of you know 735 which is 100 percentile.
Speaker: agent

18:18
If I give them a test GMAT test and instead of 2 and half hours if I give them say 4 hours of time, surprisingly what you would say is both of them would have almost the same score.
Speaker: agent

18:27
So the idea is once you reach a 625, there is nothing much at a conceptual level that you have to sit and watch or learn.
Speaker: agent

18:34
What you need is a fine tuning in your technique and time management.
Speaker: agent

18:39
And that cannot happen via chat because it becomes too complicated to explain things in chat.
Speaker: agent

18:44
So in the last mail push program, you would be getting the OR connected with the mentor and teams call where they would come in and they would, you know, share their screen, show you the stats based on how you performed here.
Speaker: agent

18:55
We collect a lot of data.
Speaker: agent

18:56
This business that you see, it's not just accuracy.
Speaker: agent

18:59
We collect your average correct time, incorrect time, the pressure plots and all these things and then accordingly we give you suggestions in terms of fine tuning and improvement of time.
Speaker: agent

19:09
So that is what your mental doing and that will be a one on one live session that will be having with the mentor free of cost.
Speaker: agent

19:16
So the program is called the last mail Bush even you would be involved in.
Speaker: agent

19:20
So in just to give you a clarity, all the students who you see here in our platform TGMAT in U2, all the students got 685695685 655675 all the students have part of last meal question program that is a default part of our course.
Speaker: agent

19:37
And that is one of the reasons why we have this huge success.
Speaker: agent

19:40
You just have to see one thing all prep providers would have their own I mean YouTube channels.
Speaker: agent

19:46
So just check how many verified reviews or you know verified videos are coming from their end and you will be surprised to see that we have 3 extra time of success rates, you know, published and.
Speaker: agent

20:00
With a score of 675 plus, so you know, just just to give you that testimony and all these videos are not just in a 2 minute video messaging that hey, I learned from here.
Speaker: agent

20:11
That is why I was able to succeed.
Speaker: agent

20:12
No Sir.
Speaker: agent

20:14
Strategic discussion videos are of 40 minutes, 30 minutes, all the things where they would discuss their journey, which eventually even if you are not plan purchasing our course, you want to do a cell study.
Speaker: agent

20:25
These videos could be helpful if you are travelling or something just listen to this listen to this videos would be really helpful for you to understand and come over some of the you know aspects.
Speaker: agent

20:34
Of course each students journey would be different, but the core of it would be the same.
Speaker: agent

20:40
So they have and means every student here has embedded your course correct?
Speaker: prospect

20:46
Yeah, every student is part of you know has studied in our course and you know all the students are part of the normal mentorship program as well as once 625 from 625.
Speaker: agent

20:55
All the scores here are 625 plus studied at least 645655 is what you going to see.
Speaker: agent

21:01
You don't even see 635 here.
Speaker: agent

21:03
So everybody is part of the last value push program and everybody was our student.
Speaker: agent

21:06
So and we we cannot randomly post someone you know account right And if you look at GMAT club, GMAT club is a place where you find the largest community of GMAT.
Speaker: agent

21:17
You know aspirants across the globe.
Speaker: agent

21:20
If we just go there and check the number of reviews you would see we have towards the times number of reviews with a score of 4.8.
Speaker: agent

21:26
So the reason is because, you know, so we cannot simply go and nobody can do a PR work there.
Speaker: agent

21:34
Nobody can go there and just, you know, give a review, posture review.
Speaker: agent

21:39
You have to show your actual score, you have submit your actual report and you also have to show that you studied in this place.
Speaker: agent

21:45
You actually give a review.
Speaker: agent

21:47
So all all are verified reviews.
Speaker: agent

21:49
And that is why you would see only around, you know, 2000, 3000 kind of reviews because it is a tedious process and only the people who are really interested would do that.
Speaker: agent

21:57
And yeah, so you'd see compared to the top test providers, what what's the difference you would see, will I not get the mba.com test mock test that is available paid test including this course?
Speaker: prospect

22:11
No, we have a dedicated test.
Speaker: agent

22:12
No, we have spent millions of dollars in R&D to create a finding the fine tune test, which is replica of your action agreement.
Speaker: agent

22:19
So you have 5 full length tests within our platform itself because you have 3.
Speaker: agent

22:24
That test is a computer based like we have a negative marking and if you answer right, the answer means the next question is more harder and then if you get it wrong, yeah, it's adaptive.
Speaker: prospect

22:37
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

22:37
So your is also adaptive and exactly, exactly.
Speaker: agent

22:41
So all the students which you see here it may be can try to contribute them in LinkedIn.
Speaker: agent

22:45
Unfortunately, if phone numbers cannot be shared because you know, that's private even even you know, if you are also in future coming here, we cannot share your phone number also.
Speaker: agent

22:55
So you can reach out to these people and LinkedIn, they have studied there, you can get a real time, you know, inputs from them and all the tests, all the students would say one thing that the score is plus or -10 from the actual marks that they have taken towards the end, they have got a plus or -10 So that is a really good, you know, accuracy in terms of the actual test.
Speaker: agent

23:16
So, so so just just to answer your question, yes, our courses, our section marks are adaptive and that is the only way we can actually checkout how many more sectional adaptive 90 mocks 5 full length test 90 sectional mocks.
Speaker: agent

23:36
OK sectional mock means mock for your verbal, mock for your quant mock for your data and separately OK yeah, you can even get the our sectional mock are also adaptive it minors the actual, you know, GMAT scenario.
Speaker: prospect

23:53
So if verbal is there 45 minute 26 question adaptive and you will have to solve it in the real time.
Speaker: agent

23:58
So Nestle you not need not take the full length test to check your level before verbal.
Speaker: agent

24:04
See, once you complete your verbal, you are going to test your sections first and verbal to understand if you have improved and all these things and then Quans India all these sections.
Speaker: agent

24:13
OK so in the GMAT exam do they give us means pen paper to write solve the questions in the if I go to you will you will get a notepad no computerized notepad in real exam not computerized notepad.
Speaker: prospect

24:28
You can actually you will also get a physical notepad in your actual term.
Speaker: agent

24:33
And what about the study materials you will be giving me the that registered official book guides as a you to to be honest, you don't need the official guide because our see to create a platform.
Speaker: prospect

24:48
We have been existing since as a platform since 2008.
Speaker: agent

24:52
So we are the Ogs of you know, GMAT pref in terms of online GMAT since 2008.
Speaker: agent

24:59
So we have done a lot of you know, millions of dollars we have spent for the course and all these things, which in itself is sufficient.
Speaker: agent

25:07
So that's that's a one stop solution for all the questions.
Speaker: agent

25:09
But if in case you want the mock, this is not an e GMAT offering, but I can I have some PDF of it.
Speaker: agent

25:16
I can send you some PDF version of the mock like the OG not the mock the OG original guides 44 books are there.
Speaker: agent

25:24
I can send you the PDFNVC test is going to be online right?
Speaker: agent

25:27
So you don't have to purchase a physical book, you can actually do it from that PDF books itself.
Speaker: agent

25:34
Then the the Ogs are generally designed for towards the end of your prep to use a question bank.
Speaker: agent

25:40
It is not something which you are you have to use as a study material.
Speaker: agent

25:44
It is a question bank that you are you have to use towards the end of your prep.
Speaker: agent

25:48
So mentor would clearly tell you when to use and all the things OK, so study materials is the videos that you will do a you have recommended me during the initial time self based recordings right right of you will be interactive video lessons.
Speaker: prospect

26:05
Interactive means no, it's a recorded session.
Speaker: prospect

26:07
So how it can be interactive?
Speaker: prospect

26:09
I I will show you.
Speaker: agent

26:10
So suppose if you know you are every every videos as as they start put test with a pre quiz.
Speaker: agent

26:18
I will I will just quickly rather show you OK and how much Yeah, before you show me, can you just tell me one more answer key when by what?
Speaker: agent

26:38
What is the turn around time by which is the the reviewer or the my guide replies to me.
Speaker: prospect

26:44
Suppose I have raised one query.
Speaker: prospect

26:45
What is the tat they take 18 hours maximum in us.
Speaker: agent

26:50
But because when you depending upon what you ask, if it is very simple to communicate, it will be fast.
Speaker: agent

26:56
But if you have a doubt or something where we have to record and send it to you maximum 18 hours.
Speaker: agent

26:59
So that is the rat.
Speaker: agent

27:03
Can you suppose I am feeling any, any issues with the same or any technical issue, whatever kind of issue, whom do I contact?
Speaker: prospect

27:11
Because everything is online, no Technical Support is going to be the 3rd stat is going to be around, you know, 3 hours or something.
Speaker: agent

27:18
So you reach out be 3 to 4 hours the Technical Support or something or the other and if you actually have doubt regarding platform itself, you can reach out to me directly.
Speaker: agent

27:29
Then the tab is like do you guys have any office in Mumbai?
Speaker: prospect

27:34
No, we don't have an office in Mumbai.
Speaker: agent

27:35
It is a US based company.
Speaker: agent

27:37
So we have office in Bangalore but not in Mumbai.
Speaker: agent

27:42
So you sit in Bangalore?
Speaker: prospect

27:44
Yes, I sit in Bangalore.
Speaker: agent

27:47
OK, yeah, OK.
Speaker: prospect

27:49
You can go ahead with the video.
Speaker: prospect

28:03
One second, if you take this file, I will take you a couple of files.
Speaker: agent

28:15
So first thing that you are going to learn, you cannot hear the audio so you can just see it.
Speaker: agent

28:21
So initially you are you are going to have an agenda of what you are going to study and what is the purpose of it.
Speaker: agent

28:28
Here you have concept and summary where you would be navigating through.
Speaker: agent

28:31
So if it is, if it is particular thing, you are going to have this particular scenario.
Speaker: agent

28:38
So this is actually based on initially when you start, you are going to have a test.
Speaker: agent

28:42
If I start over, I will show you that we start with the test.
Speaker: agent

28:46
The same thing.
Speaker: agent

28:46
Let me open it for you.
Speaker: agent

28:48
I will resume no.
Speaker: agent

28:53
So you will have the agenda.
Speaker: agent

28:55
Once your agenda is done, you are going to click here.
Speaker: agent

29:00
So with within within this you are going to have a question.
Speaker: agent

29:07
You have to mark the right answer based on what you infer.
Speaker: agent

29:09
So initially you are going to do it on your own and based on the right answers and wrong answers.
Speaker: agent

29:14
Suppose if I simply mark this based on how you solve this question, your video would be that length.
Speaker: agent

29:20
Suppose if you get all all right, your video would be really short.
Speaker: agent

29:23
But if you if you get all questions wrong, your video would be the longest.
Speaker: agent

29:27
So that is that is what in terms of interactive video lessons means based on how you get or the feedback that you give accordingly you are you are going to have a review.
Speaker: agent

29:38
So in this case you got only 2 right.
Speaker: agent

29:44
Let me mute.
Speaker: agent

29:46
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

29:47
So you are going to have so your mentor is actually talking the back end.
Speaker: agent

29:49
Its its your you know your subject what is actually talking the back end.
Speaker: agent

29:54
So the audio is not there.
Speaker: agent

29:55
But see, for you to understand how we teach, checkout the free trial, which is there in the website.
Speaker: agent

30:00
So that would because you have to hear also, right?
Speaker: agent

30:02
If I just show you, yeah, you're just saying it, but is it right treatment for you and all these things that is possible only if you do it yourself.
Speaker: agent

30:11
So checkout the free trial, which is there in the platform, how checkout how we teach.
Speaker: agent

30:16
Are you comfortable with the teaching without in that case, good to go.
Speaker: agent

30:20
If not, it's your call.
Speaker: agent

30:22
So that's what I recommend so that you can have a detailed understanding rather than me just showing it.
Speaker: agent

30:29
So the idea behind the interactivity lesson is it is going to progress in terms of how you respond for this questions.
Speaker: agent

30:35
Everyday can be short, video can be long.
Speaker: agent

30:36
Here the estimated time is 35 minutes, but you took 36 minutes.
Speaker: agent

30:40
Here the estimated time is 35, recommended time is 35 minutes, you finish in 28 minutes.
Speaker: agent

30:45
Similarly here recommended time is 25 minutes, you finish in 2038 seconds, like 38 minutes here 40 minutes almost same time.
Speaker: agent

30:52
So depending upon your capability and your understanding, a video can be shorter or lengthy.
Speaker: agent

31:02
OK, so are there any free test also that you are giving?
Speaker: prospect

31:08
We give one free mock.
Speaker: agent

31:10
So 1 + 1 + 4I have or 1 + 5 mock test 1 + 4.
Speaker: prospect

31:16
You can see one the first Test.
Speaker: agent

31:17
We keep it open because you can suppose if you want you can create an alternate account just for the one mock.
Speaker: agent

31:23
You can do that from there also.
Speaker: agent

31:24
But generally we recommend that diagnostic quiz.
Speaker: agent

31:27
The first mock is a diagnostic test to understand where your level is.
Speaker: agent

31:30
Then remaining 4 mocks to be kept at the end and the 2 free, you know GMAT mba.com mocks, you can use it towards end as well.
Speaker: agent

31:39
OK, So 1 + 45 + 2 that 7, Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

31:48
OK, So what is the fees?
Speaker: prospect

31:50
How do you sell pay scores?
Speaker: agent

31:53
You are looking for 2 months, 4 months or 6 months?
Speaker: agent

31:56
What's your idea?
Speaker: agent

31:58
So how does it matter?
Speaker: prospect

32:00
Duration matters.
Speaker: agent

32:02
So suppose if you it's a subscription plan.
Speaker: agent

32:03
So if it is 2 months, you have access only till 2 months.
Speaker: agent

32:07
So that how how do you know that?
Speaker: agent

32:09
If based on how you know what's your starting score is, you can take a free mock test.
Speaker: agent

32:13
So that's what we tell you.
Speaker: agent

32:16
You can take a free mock test based on your score.
Speaker: agent

32:18
We can recommend you, you know which one to choose twice on your score and mock test, it was between 400 to 450.
Speaker: prospect

32:27
If it is between 400 to 450, how many hours are on weekly basis can you give for your preparation?
Speaker: agent

32:33
Daily one hour and on Saturday, Sunday I can give you 2 to 4 to 5 + 99 hours.
Speaker: prospect

32:39
9 to 10 hours you would you would require 6 months of time based on number of hours 4 you require 6 months of time.
Speaker: agent

32:47
You give your mock score.
Speaker: agent

32:48
I can create and share it with you because there is no replacement for that number of us.
Speaker: agent

32:53
See based on your score.
Speaker: agent

32:56
Suppose let me just just creating for once and I would have created for you also if you had the score score I am telling you now 425 lets no, no just not just 425.
Speaker: prospect

33:05
I want your quant score, verbal score, DI score and your percentiles also in CRRCI want to know in detail to create it.
Speaker: agent

33:12
It is not just based on the total score, it is also based on suppose here we need to capture this data points.
Speaker: agent

33:18
What is your starting scope for verbal?
Speaker: agent

33:20
What is your CR percentile, RC percentile, quants, percentile arithmetic, algebra, all these things that given lets me go back check if you have let me know now itself.
Speaker: agent

33:35
We can see I have I have given an E GMAT only I don't know.
Speaker: prospect

33:42
OK, so just you just dictated to me then mock.
Speaker: agent

33:56
Alright, I will mock.
Speaker: prospect

35:08
Do you wish to share your screen?
Speaker: agent

35:09
I will help you navigate.
Speaker: agent

35:13
Yeah, I have to go to E GMAT right?
Speaker: prospect

35:17
You share your screen, I will help you navigate.
Speaker: agent

35:38
No, I have not taken on your portal.
Speaker: prospect

35:41
I might have taken on mba.com.
Speaker: prospect

35:44
Okay, you can take from there.
Speaker: agent

35:45
In that case, that's okay enough for you.
Speaker: prospect

35:49
No, that's okay.
Speaker: agent

35:57
mba.com free GMAT test.
Speaker: prospect

35:59
I am writing it up.
Speaker: prospect

37:05
We're not getting.
Speaker: agent

37:06
Let's create a scenario and show it to you.
Speaker: agent

37:11
If you vaguely remember, let's put a scenario and do it.
Speaker: agent

37:14
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

37:16
OK, so what's your target score?
Speaker: agent

37:20
710 Let's 710710 is equivalent to 665 focus.
Speaker: prospect

37:27
Why means how you are saying this number I I don't know means check in mba.com understand your score.
Speaker: prospect

37:32
You just have to Google it.
Speaker: agent

37:33
It can just check it out in mba.com.
Speaker: agent

37:36
Just type in you know understand your score from there you would see the test format has changed.
Speaker: agent

37:42
So that's why it's a new format from 2023 yes yes yes so it's more harder you have it's harder it's harder yes yes so they have removed 1X means they have removed some I think sections.
Speaker: prospect

37:58
So now they have removed you do not have a sentence correction, you do not have analytical writing, you do not have algebra like within within quants, you do not have geometry.
Speaker: agent

38:09
And there was something called IR section integrated listening that is removed and now new section is added data insights.
Speaker: agent

38:17
So, yeah, but they have increased the that account means what do you say the hardness of the test?
Speaker: prospect

38:28
Well, it does not to be honest, it does not matter because eventually earlier you it was more competitive even though it was easier.
Speaker: agent

38:35
You need to get a 710.
Speaker: agent

38:37
That same amount of effort would take you here also to get a you know, 6710 is equivalent to 655 right now.
Speaker: agent

38:45
So, so in a way that is almost the same because you are competing, right?
Speaker: agent

38:50
It is percentile and percentage.
Speaker: agent

38:52
So that is why it is you know it is not going to affect you.
Speaker: agent

38:56
The tough exam being tougher is gonna be exam being tougher for everyone.
Speaker: agent

39:00
So you don't have to worry.
Speaker: agent

39:03
OK yes.
Speaker: prospect

39:04
So lets lets take a 730 kind of score.
Speaker: agent

39:09
So 665 will take if that's OK 93rd percentile your current score is 400.
Speaker: agent

39:17
What 4425 lets take 425.
Speaker: prospect

39:23
OK, so it was an mba.com test and that's put your verbal in a way what your score was Cipher verbal quant dot DI where was it high almost considered it as 70 707570 yeah.
Speaker: prospect

39:56
Surukada 665 you have to get a sum of score of 83 on an average.
Speaker: agent

40:01
So you need to get a 259 that is 838383 on an average.
Speaker: agent

40:06
Wherever there is deficit, there has to be surplus in the other section to compensate.
Speaker: agent

40:10
So the sum of score you are chasing is 259249246 is 6.
Speaker: agent

40:22
45 is equivalent to like 645 is you know you will get 645 when you have on average 828282 each in each other section on an average.
Speaker: agent

40:32
So you would get a 645 if you get on average 838383 each you get an the score of 665 838383.
Speaker: agent

40:43
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

40:47
OK.
Speaker: agent

40:50
Just structuring your internal and just putting the cap wherever it applies.
Speaker: agent

41:08
But how much time it will take to for me to you know that that would know once once we finalise and create this plan it see and could be a tentative GMAT tested.
Speaker: prospect

41:22
So what is the number of hours you can give Monday to Friday?
Speaker: agent

41:26
Lets take 11:50 hours Monday to Friday.
Speaker: agent

41:30
Friday daily one hour on Saturday, Sunday 22 hours 2 to 2.5 OK 22 hours on weekends is 9 hours of time.
Speaker: prospect

41:52
And when are you planning to start lets say on 15th January, OK to take time till 25th of September to get a target score of this which is way more because the time.
Speaker: agent

42:09
So I will tell you why because there is no replacement for the time that you give either you have to increase your time or decrease your score.
Speaker: agent

42:17
You have to go for a 645 kind of score.
Speaker: agent

42:19
So this is something which is pretty accurate to the core.
Speaker: agent

42:24
So in terms of the time and plan your for your bubble, you take 101, 101 hours once around 18 hours and data insights you take around 82 hours from your current level.
Speaker: agent

42:37
OK, so I can give you my personal time.
Speaker: prospect

42:40
Sorry, sorry, sorry to interrupt you, but I have got the actual data.
Speaker: prospect

42:46
Can I share my screen?
Speaker: prospect

42:47
OK.
Speaker: agent

42:49
No, you can tell you can tell me.
Speaker: agent

42:50
That's OK.
Speaker: agent

42:50
You, you.
Speaker: agent

42:51
No, no, I am not understanding.
Speaker: prospect

42:53
You can only analyse and let me know where is your this is one conversation.
Speaker: prospect

43:02
Sorry teams.
Speaker: prospect

43:05
OK, I can share my screen, correct?
Speaker: prospect

43:08
So I have shared my screen yeah.
Speaker: prospect

43:14
Where is the new window?
Speaker: prospect

43:16
Can you see?
Speaker: prospect

43:18
Yeah, I can see 455.
Speaker: agent

43:22
Okay, so cons data and science verbal 707573.
Speaker: prospect

43:33
Okay, so it is going to be just minor difference you would be finishing it in you know towards you know starting of August maybe one month difference you would have because we have taken 425 and Quans is also you know 35th percentile.
Speaker: agent

43:49
So you would you would take time to go from that because the target score that we are taking is close to 90th percentile in each of the section.
Speaker: agent

43:57
So you take if you are, if either you have to increase your number of hours from 9 hours to 15 hours, 50 hours, in that case it will be different.
Speaker: agent

44:06
Otherwise you, you take this time.
Speaker: agent

44:09
OK, what if I go with the live sessions maybe one month here and there extra that you know you did go faster.
Speaker: prospect

44:20
But see I am not telling see for you to take a 6 months course.
Speaker: agent

44:23
I am just telling your reality be it be it easy mat or be it outside.
Speaker: agent

44:27
There is a scale metrics with which you take some particular time.
Speaker: agent

44:30
So you have to boost up your number of hours of time commitments in terms of a prep.
Speaker: agent

44:34
You have to increase it considering your score, you have to increase it to say 15 hours, 20 hours.
Speaker: agent

44:40
There is no option if you are actually if you really want to do it in say you know 4 months of time, you have to increase your, you know time almost level.
Speaker: agent

44:50
So because the number of hours which is there, there is no replacement.
Speaker: agent

44:55
So see I can be you know I can, I can I could have told you some but that OK 4 months would be enough you just purchase but that will be unrealistic expectations what has been said.
Speaker: agent

45:05
So I have to show you the reality.
Speaker: agent

45:07
Let us do one thing if I take now 4 months course and if it does not contain I can extend to 2 months more that is OK you can you can extend it to 2 months more.
Speaker: prospect

45:15
You can start with 2 months also you can send it to the same price.
Speaker: agent

45:19
It will be $89 extra for each of the month.
Speaker: agent

45:24
So so means let us suppose what is your price of 18 month course?
Speaker: prospect

45:30
Sorry 6 month course for 6 months course right now it is $399 which is 34,000.
Speaker: agent

45:37
We have some discounts also running.
Speaker: agent

45:40
So you would get it for say 27,027, 1000.
Speaker: agent

45:43
So what is the price of 4 month course?
Speaker: prospect

45:47
It is actually $299 which is around 26,500, but with discount you are going to get it for 21,000, 21 and 27.
Speaker: agent

45:56
OK, let's suppose now the 21,000 crores I take and I want to extend for 2 months more.
Speaker: prospect

46:02
So you told me $18 more you're gonna pay $89, $89, 89.
Speaker: agent

46:07
So it will be around 7500 more per month.
Speaker: agent

46:12
So it comes around the same figure.
Speaker: agent

46:16
It's coming more, right?
Speaker: prospect

46:18
21,000 + 7500 is 28,500 for 5 months and then again 7500 is 36,000 where 6 months directly if you purchase in this exactly 27,000.
Speaker: prospect

46:29
So but The thing is you can decide if to go for if you are able to finish in 4 months you will be saving that is the benefit if you finish the course in 4 months if you are able to do that you will be saving your money if not you have even more price.
Speaker: agent

46:44
So you will be giving me this course no Means you won't be giving me this the same amount if I don't take the 6 month course correct?
Speaker: prospect

46:55
If I want to extend 21,000 crores I have to bear the loss correct?
Speaker: prospect

47:00
I won't get it in the same amount of the 6 month course.
Speaker: prospect

47:04
The thing is we allow a small window of 1015 days of purchase.
Speaker: agent

47:09
Suppose you purchased you know within 1015 days.
Speaker: agent

47:13
If you are able to come back to us and say that hey, no, I want to pay the difference and take the 6 months that happens but not after 4 months then on the extension is there then yes, you would have to during the course on the 3rd month.
Speaker: agent

47:25
If I decide then no, most probably not That depends on the support team there.
Speaker: prospect

47:31
You know, it depends on that situation, particular situation, but you need not consider.
Speaker: agent

47:36
I don't want to promise you may happen, but it is it is something which which I don't want to promise you because generally don't generally if you don't do the you know, pay the difference then but yeah, OK, because the amount you are saying is very high or considering the sale pay score because I have I have been interacting with other if you remember, no IMSIMS something like that.
Speaker: agent

48:06
So they are giving me a live session of 3 months and means the same amount that you are saying 34, 35,000 but the live session you can check their results.
Speaker: prospect

48:19
So the to be honest what I am telling is it does not say in in your case if you are taking live course if that is better for you, you can go for that.
Speaker: agent

48:28
But the idea is here the kind of analytics and the mental support that you are getting.
Speaker: agent

48:33
I am doubtful if batch is something which works for you like you want to be enrolled.
Speaker: agent

48:37
It is a one on one session that you are going to get for 3 months.
Speaker: prospect

48:40
Yes, yes, they will be giving me 93030 minute sessions, one on one.
Speaker: prospect

48:47
So OK, apart from the live session, so 15 hours, 15 hours of live, right?
Speaker: agent

48:53
No, no, the live session will go on everyday.
Speaker: prospect

48:56
But apart from that, if you want to have a doubt session, if you have 510 doubts, you can schedule a 30 minute call, like 30 minute call or one will be one on one apart from the live sessions, OK, yeah, so it is very interactive.
Speaker: prospect

49:10
You know I can ask right away if I have 10 questions.
Speaker: prospect

49:13
I am solving it out if I 10 curries, I will schedule a call and then solve it right away instead of, you know, chatting in the box and you can you can see the idea is we just tell you what we offer in terms of what is the offering so that you can take an informed decision.
Speaker: prospect

49:30
If you feel that that is more aligned with your case, you can go with that.
Speaker: agent

49:35
But see what are the reason I was telling is so you just have to compare the results.
Speaker: agent

49:39
So taking a lesson can anybody can do, but what is the result?
Speaker: agent

49:43
How many you know, result got published, not the brochure that they give, but in the actual scenario in public market, we cannot lie, right?
Speaker: agent

49:52
So their their YouTube channel, they also will have just checkout the result.
Speaker: agent

49:55
So accordingly you will see the difference in that.
Speaker: agent

49:59
But yeah, if live class is something you want to go with, you have to go with that.
Speaker: agent

50:06
So that's that's as simple as that.
Speaker: agent

50:08
But what I the purpose of this call is to help you understand what we offer and accordingly you can take a choice.
Speaker: agent

50:13
What works best for you can take a choice.
Speaker: agent

50:17
So tell me the last amount that you will do for 4 and 6 month course.
Speaker: prospect

50:21
Can you come on for the 6 month course for up to 21,000?
Speaker: prospect

50:25
No, we have standard discounts.
Speaker: agent

50:27
So $80 discount is what you get from a $399.
Speaker: agent

50:31
You are going to get a discount of $80 which is $319.
Speaker: agent

50:35
That is what the price is and that will be around 27,000.
Speaker: agent

50:40
You cannot go beyond that.
Speaker: prospect

50:42
No, no, we have standard pricing in terms of the offers.
Speaker: agent

50:45
When we give discounts, you know, we have the standard pricing.
Speaker: agent

50:48
We never have gone up or down.
Speaker: agent

50:50
So we do not have a price of say $319 or 6 months.
Speaker: agent

50:53
We with discounts you are going to get it for $319.
Speaker: agent

50:56
We have never sold for $345.
Speaker: agent

50:58
Also we have never sold for, you know $281 or $285 also.
Speaker: agent

51:03
It is always a standard price.
Speaker: agent

51:05
So yeah.
Speaker: agent

51:16
OK.
Speaker: prospect

51:17
So yes, I think that's it then.
Speaker: prospect

51:20
Then it's a final price then now OK, from your side it's a yes or no, correct?
Speaker: prospect

51:27
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's the same, you know, pricing that you know we have.
Speaker: agent

51:32
So yes, that's the standard pricing that we have, yeah.
Speaker: agent

51:41
Any tax GST or additional or 27,000 if you if you pay by a card you are gonna be paid 27 you will be paying 27,000.
Speaker: prospect

51:50
But if you want to use Google Pay to do net banking you would have 18% GST.
Speaker: agent

51:56
Government regulation.
Speaker: agent

51:56
So if you are paying via card because the company is waste out of US you don't have any extra charges coming by.
Speaker: agent

52:03
You are going to get it for 27,000 including everything around 27,000 $1000 if you have a card like which which allows international transaction like visa card, visa credit card or something of that sort.
Speaker: agent

52:18
If you have you can you can get it.
Speaker: agent

52:20
If not it will be 18% GST on top if you want to pay by Google Pay.
Speaker: agent

52:27
OK at Max.
Speaker: prospect

52:27
Can you do the 4 month course extension for 5 months to me?
Speaker: prospect

52:33
I am just asking you the possibility so that I can decide based on my 4 month course.
Speaker: prospect

52:40
You can give me a thank you 5 months for the same amount.
Speaker: prospect

52:45
So see you know one thing which I had like to tell you is see don't I understand that you really want to do it, but you know it's a standard pricing which is not in my hands.
Speaker: agent

52:55
Also the one thing which you can do is I can give you that coupon code for discount.
Speaker: agent

53:00
That's the standard pricing.
Speaker: agent

53:01
Otherwise if I have to do something I have to do from my pocket.
Speaker: agent

53:03
So that's that's the thing we don't do that right.
Speaker: agent

53:05
It doesn't make sense.
Speaker: agent

53:06
So the coupon code extra coupon code apart from the that you are giving me standard discount apart from that no, that discount is in coupon code.
Speaker: prospect

53:16
