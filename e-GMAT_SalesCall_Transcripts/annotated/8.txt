0:12
Hello.

0:13
Hello.

0:13
Hi, Amruth.

0:14
How are you?

0:15
Hey, Siddh, I'm good.

0:16
Thanks for asking.

0:17
How are you?

0:18
I'm good, I'm good, Right.

0:20
So Sudharth, before we start, have you taken any mocks yet?

0:26
, just just wanted to check.

0:28
Yeah, I've taken one of the mock.

0:30
So diagnostic, diagnostic test of the mv.com that the first mock that we get.

0:34
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:37
So that I have taken OK, you you have taken that.

0:41
And how was your score?

0:43
It was 425 something 425 is it?

0:48
Yeah, correct.

0:49
OK, OK.

0:50
So what's your target score?

0:52
And you know what, what is it that you're planning in terms of?

0:58
Yeah.

0:59
OK.

0:59
So firstly I'm, I'm just started to think about doing MBA firstly.

1:05
And the main reason that I choosing GMAT over CAT is that I'm already, I'm already having a good amount of like I'm getting a good salary.

1:14
What if I'm working so far?

1:16
So it doesn't make any sense to do MVA from India because I, I will have a yeah, average package of that much only.

1:22
So that's why.

1:24
So that's the reason.

1:26
And and I started the GMAT I have I'm like I'm I got I went to all the resources and all GMAT club and such all things.

1:33
I am kind of confused right now first thing is that like, you know, am I too late for the applying for the GMAT or something like that?

1:40
I have a work experience of around 2.5 years 2.5 right.

1:45
How how it will be late like in terms of see the round one application for anyways this year application is mostly close.

1:53
So correct, correct.

1:54
Yeah.

1:55
So you you starting at a 425, it's not that sensible to look for one month or 2 month program.

2:01
So yeah, it have to have your time.

2:03
And what you have thought about like June to September.

2:07
So September would be the deadline for most of the school.

2:10
So a score in the month of July would help.

2:14
June, July at least in the starting of July or end of June is something which you can look for taking the test.

2:20
So whether with the 6 months of prep is what you need to look at.

2:24
And you should be looking if you are looking outside India, you should be looking for a score of you know 6957 not 5 plus see you know you would see in most of the schools written 71072730.

2:37
So those are classic edition.

2:40
So we had classic edition first and now it's focus edition.

2:43
So the test has changed.

2:45
So the people have taken classic edition in 2020 their their course is still valid till 2025.

2:51
They can apply the schools with that score itself.

2:53
So that's why most of the schools have, you know, this aspect covered or you know, the the scores which they mentioned the website to is to include them as well.

3:05
So they have not changed it maybe from 2026 you will see the focus edition specific target schools, target scores for this schools.

3:13
So yeah, if you are looking at the top schools like in CR Paris, say Howard, Stanford, if you are looking for the top schools, that median is at 6:00, 85 kind of score.

3:22
So you should be looking at 30 point on top of that.

3:24
So it will not be the median range, it will be, you know, I arranged a 77 and 5 could be a good score to chase.

3:32
You know, in terms of your prep together 7 and 5 you have to have a total sum of.

3:39
I hope you are aware of GMAT structure.

3:42
Are you?

3:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:43
I have gone through all the structure and all.

3:45
So I am pretty much aware about the GMAT Focus edition and how it is different from the classic edition.

3:50
So I am pretty good aware of that, yeah.

3:52
Yeah.

3:52
So the scale score start from 60 to 90, V 60 to V 90, D 60 to D 90 and Q 60 to Q 90.

4:01
And what you need to get as 715 is the sum of score of 256 is what you need to get as 715.

4:09
So irrespective of which combination you look at, you have to get a, you know 2256 that that's what you are going to cheat.

4:18
Yeah, OK.

4:18
So that being said, So what we are going to look at is or maybe in this call itself, I will create a plan and show it to you so that you would understand how many hours on verbal content.

4:29
Yeah, you're gonna put.

4:31
But apart from that, you know, just wanted to ask how did you hear about us?

4:36
Sorry, Easy.

4:36
And what how did you hear about easy?

4:38
I I went to the YouTube modus, most of the channels.

4:42
So yeah, that's all I went to.

4:44
OK, OK, OK, OK.

4:46
Yeah, yeah.

4:47
So generally we get a lot of students coming through our own existing students.

4:51
So that's what I was just checking if that's the case.

4:53
OK, All right, so that's OK.

4:56
So what are the things that I would like to understand in this call so that we can accordingly discuss?

5:01
OK, sure.

5:02
So I'm kind of like kind of not sure, like, you know, because I was, I was going through videos and a lot of people like, you know, the starting point where something 525 or something and I'm almost way too low from 425.

5:16
So that's the pretty much confusion that, you know, like am I way too low scoring that way?

5:22
And apart from that, how this structure will be working because I will have a I will be working during this whole time and definitely I will be looking forward to do this.

5:31
Applying is for the September round.

5:33
So definitely I will be looking forward to around what?

5:36
Yeah, June, July, I will be ready to give the test.

5:39
So that's what I'm targeting right now.

5:41
Yeah, yeah.

5:43
So do you have this course open right now?

5:46
Can you just take the scores?

5:48
OK.

5:48
Just 425.

5:50
Yeah, just accordingly we will create a plan.

5:52
OK, sure, sure.

5:52
Just give me a minute.

5:53
I will just let you.

5:57
Meanwhile, I am just sharing my screen.

6:00
Yeah, you can just dictate your scores to me.

6:05
Once you take it, let me know.

6:06
OK.

6:07
Yeah.

6:12
See it is all about irrespective of the starting point, what matters is how long it is going to take.

6:18
See irrespective of the scores that you get, what we are actually more keen on is to understand how long it is going to take because GMAT is a very has a very defined syllabus.

6:28
So one of the key elements of GMAT is we have a very defined syllabus and you are going to get questions on it from those type of questions.

6:34
The type of questions are also limited in terms of verbal content di.

6:38
So that is one of the reasons why you see most of the prep programs are limited to 6 months because if you are taking more than 6 months to 7 months for GMAT, that means that you are doing things wrong somewhere.

6:51
Maybe your study was not in the right direction, you had a lot of gaps in terms of your prep, maybe you have not studied everyday.

6:57
So a lot of factors would account for it if if there is an extension beyond that.

7:03
So because you know when, when a very different topic is there, it is like, you know, just for example, your test in your, you know, bachelors, the OR, or in your school, you have a syllabus, you are going to finish it in one point of time or the other.

7:16
Even if you are someone who is at a really low score and you are in the failing category of out of 100, you are getting 10 in your test does not mean that you are never going to hit 100, right?

7:27
It is not, does not mean that you are never going to hit in IT.

7:29
It is all about how you prepare yourself to get to that 90.

7:32
You have to learn from the fundamentals.

7:34
You have to do a lot of fundamental study within our platform, which is so our course is also really comprehensive.

7:39
So the difference between you and someone who is starting at the 535 years.

7:43
I can also show you one of the confidence students studying at a 55 in 3 months go to a store of 715555 have gone to a 765 in around 4 months.

7:54
In your case the 3 months from 425 to 7 15 May not be that realistic.

8:00
But of course double the time you know 4 to around 5 to 6 months and one other aspect is to go from 425 to 555 like they are starting point you are going to get faster because the learning curve towards the initial you know the span of score improvement during the initial phase of score improvement is going to be easy.

8:20
300 to 400 is easy then going from 400 to 500 correct.

8:25
And so going from this 500 to 600 is difficult and then 600 to 700 is even difficult.

8:32
From 700 to 800 is going to be even difficult.

8:34
So it is going to be exponential, not linear in terms of the efforts that you have to put.

8:39
So that being said, you are going to get to what what their starting point was in maybe around a month, months time, 100 point improvement.

8:48
You can you are going to see in 30 to 40 days depending upon the number of hours you put in and then you are going to start from there.

8:54
So maybe you take a couple of months more, but that is what you would have to do.

8:59
So yeah, once you take your score, let me know I will create it.

9:01
Yeah, yeah, sure.

10:36
Hi.

12:48
Where have you taken the mock from this nba.com is it?

12:52
Yeah, mba.com now, OK, after that.

13:05
Actually I after that giving that ma.com I just started, you know, with the basic preparation of, you know, just the formulas and how this works and all.

13:15
So after that, I don't want to consume the second test.

13:19
So that's why I gave the Yeah, you shouldn't you shouldn't see the results of mock is actually limited.

13:25
You cannot you know wasted its bit scarce to be precise to get the real you know adaptive mocks kind of thing it's actually going to be a bit difficult yeah, GMAT is GMAT is not loading.

13:49
So not sure why it is that's OK in your case, like the way I said, I could have just created even the same study plan you are going to create once you, you know, purchase, you know, once you take up the course, you are going to have this see, like can you just see my screen?

14:06
Yeah, I can see your screen.

14:09
So you are going to have this getting started videos, the plan where you are going to actually understand how to create this study plan.

14:15
So in your case, I am pretty sure since you had this problem, that is why I thought I will help you with that or else I can just do you remember the scores at least on verbal content?

14:24
DI I will can I tell you about this test that I gave on Maghush in that actually yeah, you can, you can let me know.

14:33
OK, So what is the score there?

14:36
The score was 505 and for the quantitative it is 78.

14:44
So let's let's keep your target.

14:46
So we will we will take that score right now.

14:48
So maybe later on you can create a plan later on with the existing or you know, once once you get in.

14:56
So you can do that.

14:57
So it's 99 percentile, which is your target.

14:59
And yeah, score is 5, not 50505, correct, Correct.

15:04
OK.

15:04
And it was, I'm just keeping it as india.com mock and verbal was how much Verbal was 7676, Quant, Swiss quant was 78, 78 and data insights it was 7171.

15:28
Meanwhile, before that, could you just share me the your share screen and just show it to me quickly?

15:35
Is that possible?

15:36
Yeah, sure, sure.

15:42
My screen is visible.

15:45
Yes, yes, it is visible.

15:46
Yeah.

15:48
So lets take the most recent one, September one, yeah.

15:54
So just see the results.

15:56
Yeah, can just click see result detail.

15:59
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

16:10
Yeah.

16:11
So lets take quant, lets quickly go down.

16:15
Lets lets see.

16:23
Yeah.

16:24
OK.

16:24
Still can you get it a bit lower, just question wise, is there this one?

16:32
OK, so hard question you got wrong with AC OK, OK, just one second, a bit slow.

16:43
Just wanted to see.

16:44
Yeah, yeah.

16:59
See one of the troubles with this and the inconsistency in the markers because just tell you a scenario.

17:06
Yeah, we started with a hard question.

17:09
As soon as the first question was wrong, directly switched to EC, not medium and then medium, EC, medium, the second and 3rd was fine and you got right and then went to hard and then again hard got wrong.

17:21
Medium, that is fine.

17:22
Medium got right and you got to hard.

17:25
Hard got wrong again, you got hard.

17:27
That is OK, inconsistent with the above pattern but still it is fine.

17:31
Then hard got right.

17:32
Then you saw medium.

17:34
OK, so, so it is not that you know so, so we will see.

17:39
The medium also got right.

17:40
Then you got again hard, hard got wrong, medium hard and medium got wrong again.

17:45
You got hard question and hard question.

17:48
That hard question you got right.

17:49
Then the medium question.

17:50
So what I wanted to show you was it is a mixed bag of questions with for the sake of it, it is adaptive, but it is not the actual adaptive and the focus edition you are going to get a mixed bag of questions.

18:02
The first couple of questions would be, you know, would would determine next set of questions and then the next set of questions.

18:08
So that's how it's going to be.

18:09
So yeah, so a bit differentiating isn't it?

18:15
So where you see there are some inconsistency, that's why the score may be a deviation, but still it's fine.

18:22
Anyways, if solved there will not be much difference.

18:25
But still just wanted to show you know how generally I see this with the mocks.

18:31
That's why I just wanted to see if that's the case here also.

18:35
So, so here in the hard questions you got right in the 11th question, once you get right again, the next question was medium.

18:43
Yeah, so yeah, yeah.

18:48
Alright, so that's OK, we will get back.

18:54
So I will, I will just share my screen.

18:58
Sure yeah.

19:02
Even the experts global mock you know it is all they will give you 1012 mocks but not adaptive at all.

19:08
So it should be a bit mindful of the mocks and purchase it should see the major trouble with the mocks.

19:16
If it is not right is because you would eventually build a plan or a strategy assuming that is a scenario which is not and then you create a plan or you know a strategy for it and which would be a counterproductive.

19:29
Generally students would say that I got an mocks this is score and when I went there I got this score.

19:34
One of the reasons there are couple of reasons.

19:36
The first thing is your average accuracy across each other subscriptions might not be determined.

19:41
So you would not have known.

19:42
Suppose if you take critical reasoning, in critical reasoning you have 9 types of questions assumption, evaluate, strengthen.

19:48
We can bold face, miscellaneous we will have like fill in the blanks which is logically completes flop paradox.

19:54
So you will have around 9 types of questions and these are the only time type of questions that can come.

19:58
So you have to particularly identify and ensure that you are getting.

20:01
To get a 90th percentile you have to have a, you know 90th percentile in 95th percentile in verbal.

20:08
So in your case in verbal is 97th percentile that we need to chase.

20:11
So when we hit target this 97 percentile you have to hit around 92 to 93 percentile in CRN itself.

20:17
And similarly for RC to get A902903 percentile in CR you have to have an 80% hard accuracy.

20:23
Hard accuracy is every 10 questions you hard questions you solve you have to get 8 questions right.

20:27
To get that accuracy you have to understand for each type of question the 9 type of question within CR what is your accuracy in independently each type of question.

20:35
Most of them should not be aware of it.

20:36
What they do is they would solve then they there is a possibility that you know, say out of 95 topics they are meeting those target percentages remaining.

20:44
They are not meeting the test said hypothetically, if question pool increases or the question pool is more proportionately higher from the area of their non high areas where you they are just at 60%, 60 percentage accuracy.

20:59
If the question pool is more from there, there eventually the their accuracy is going to dip and of course, consequently their percentiles and consequently their verbal scores.

21:08
So that's why you would see a deviation in the scores in the marks that they take or in the in actual test wherever this deviation comes to course or this inconsistency which we need to address.

21:17
And most of the students when we encounter them, they would clearly tell them that they are not even aware that OK, in this 9th section what they are accuracy, they are not thought about it.

21:25
So that's one of the aspects which creates a differentiator.

21:29
The next thing is with the mock, maybe the mock would not be adaptive and they would build a strategy and then we go to the test and then realise that, OK, you know, whatever I have prepared for this not working because that's not the scenario which you wear it.

21:42
So our mocks is pretty accurate.

21:44
It's plus or -10 so to the to the action test.

21:47
So we have done a lot of R&D with that.

21:50
So, yeah, so you should make sure I am not telling that it is just us who has cracked it, but you know you just have to go to the scores and see if it makes sense.

22:01
In this case, you saw it.

22:02
When you get 2 hard or hard questions, right next will not go to medium.

22:08
It will be continuing with the hard set of questions.

22:10
At least if 3 questions are there in that majority is taken into account.

22:14
In that case it is different.

22:15
But yeah, so that sometimes does not make sense and that would be a clear indication for you that you do not make have to make.

22:22
Maybe you could take the test for solving questions, but not, you know, strategising with that.

22:27
Yeah.

22:29
All right.

22:30
Yeah, my net is a bit slow today.

22:32
OK.

22:33
So what's your CR&RC percentile in that?

22:36
Any idea in verbal?

22:40
In verbal, just just a second.

22:45
So for it's not showing in that assumption, but mostly I am I am corrected with the.

22:57
So I am just putting the capping, just putting the capping for it.

23:02
So getting bubble milestone and similarly I will create for corn just to have a fair idea and estimate into.

23:11
And to be honest we are going to consider that you take more time because we are going to take that 425 to face value.

23:19
We are going to take that.

23:20
So it is loading a bit.

23:22
Yeah, so edit, load and similarly.

23:54
You know, verbal part, I've seen that critical reasoning part was like something that I have most of the time that both of the mocks that I've attempted, they were like, I have most of them I got correct.

24:06
But with when you're talking about RC, it is super bad, like not at all.

24:11
Single.

24:11
Yeah, that's what, yeah.

24:13
So we have to cover from the fundamentals.

24:15
That's what the course would do.

24:17
So arithmetic, I'm just taking 60 and 40.

24:20
Arithmetic being higher.

24:22
Is that the case generally?

24:24
Yeah, Yeah, that is true.

24:28
OK and lets also take data insights.

24:41
Once your network is fine, it's gonna navigate like butter.

24:45
But yeah.

24:45
So in my case I guess it's a bit so that's why I am off Cam.

24:50
So the previous call it was a bit stuck.

24:53
So that's why I went off Cam for OK, better clarity.

24:59
So within DS data insights and just taking some random scores just for the sake of it.

25:08
And yeah, So what is going to happen is based on the scores that you have, you have you do to get a clear idea in terms of how many hours that you have to study and you know, how many hours you have to put for your verbal quant and DA prep as a whole.

25:22
In your case, what should be the average for you think on a working day?

25:26
And we, they, we can, you know, what do you think could be your time availability in terms of your breath?

25:35
What do you think?

25:36
2 hours?

25:37
I think it's definitely 2.5 hours.

25:39
I can definitely give because my timing will be like 9 to 7.

25:44
So after that, OK, 2 hours after skipping, let's, let's forget about the 52.5, let's skip 2 to be on safer side.

25:50
What about weekends?

25:52
Weekends I am totally free.

25:53
So we can arrange it as per whatever time which is fine.

25:58
So 5 years or 6 hours.

25:59
What do you think on an average 5 years we will keep just be on safe aside again.

26:04
And let us assume you start from say tomorrow and let us take a tentative GMAT test it.

26:09
It will be 11th of May that you should be ready with if provided this is the score.

26:13
But in your case of course a 20 days extra might might you might take because if you take 425 it would have been a bit different.

26:20
You would have gone you know maybe towards the starting of June you should be ready.

26:26
So, so around 5 to 6 months is what I also estimated.

26:30
So because that is what I have seen with students the, the achieving arts for it.

26:34
So that is what I also estimated that you would be doing that in terms of number of hours you have to give for your Rep, I will just, you are going to have a calendar view where you are going to have their understanding of what exactly has to be done.

26:47
You would have a dedicated mentor in this program.

26:49
So I have sent you one video.

26:51
Could you?

26:52
So can you just go, maybe you can go on a mute.

26:55
It is very important that's why I recommended that I have shared it you in WhatsApp video of of the mentor support.

27:03
So just watch it and lets come back maybe after 10 its its a 7 minute video should be taking you more time.

27:09
Can you just watch it and join back?

27:11
I will be in this call.

27:12
Only you can let me know once you watch it.

27:15
Sure.

27:15
Yeah.

27:15
Please.

27:15
Please send.

27:16
Yeah.

33:48
Yeah, I went through the video.

33:52
Yeah.

33:52
So that's that's regarding the mentor support that you're going to get along with the program.

33:57
So it's not something which you're going to be charged.

34:00
That's something which you're going to have by default along with the course.

34:03
So that's how you saw how the, you know, resolution if you have any topics doubt or something where you want your, you know, subject expert to create a video for you and all these things.

34:13
So all these options are there in terms of your preparation within the portal itself, you are going to have this learning modules like the way it is, it was reflecting there within verbal.

34:21
If you see in your case, you are going to start with master comprehension, you know, do you know what creates the difference between what reading competition versus struggle, right.

34:30
So generally asking, do you know what is the difference between a hard passage and an easy passage?

34:35
What do you think would be the major difference somewhere down the line?

34:39
I feel like understanding the passage deep down so that the questions will be placed as per that because what I have seen it is not direct question.

34:48
As soon as you move towards the hearts passage, you really have to understand that passage deeply understand and then you will be able to answer that particular question.

34:57
So that is I have observed so far.

35:00
OK so that is one of the byproduct to be precise.

35:04
So the major key factor which makes a passage and excel this for everyone.

35:09
I will see in your case you have let talking about your perspective but in general perspective what we see is what makes the passage difficult and easy is the structuring of sentences.

35:18
For every hard passage you would see that the passage would be comprising of a lot of long sentences like 25 to 30 words.

35:25
And So what happens is see all all this long sentences are also found using a chain of thoughts by an author.

35:34
So this chain of thoughts are formed the forms into short sentences which is interlinked to form a long sentence.

35:43
So this long sentences are responsible for you to have or or spend a lot of your time rereading things.

35:51
You would eventually eat up a lot of time which subsequently going to affect your remaining performance in your section because one section if you are if you are sitting and doing or particular set of questions, you know generally you would have seen that you are solving it.

36:04
You are taking 6 to 7 minutes to solve the first question, then again the remaining questions you are going to come back to that particular passage once again to answer those questions and that is again taking you a couple of minutes.

36:13
So technically in CR also you will eat up a lot of time for your CR as Welland then you eventually come down from that hard category to medium category to is category.

36:22
That is how it it moves and that is something which is responsible for your low score.

36:26
So we have to cover from the fundamentals.

36:29
So someone who is already at a 70th percentile or 80th percentile will recommend them to skip this because they would also already be thorough with it.

36:36
They are reading competition.

36:37
It is on point and at 8080 percentage accuracy, we generally recommend them not to take it.

36:43
In your case, you have to take it because you are going to have some learnings from here in terms of how to make your reading more effective.

36:48
So we are going to learn how this long and complicated sentences have formed in the first place.

36:52
And once you learn the art of how this long sentences are formed, then you are going to learn how to deconstruct it as single read.

36:58
And then we will have this pause points which is there which is actually going to help you understand where the pause strategically for efficient note taking and in the least possible words, how to identify what is important and what is not in a passage.

37:10
And then take notes and how to use these notes to solve your 3 or 4 questions that follows a passage and not the not the passage in itself.

37:18
So these are the strategies which the people who are at the top, you know, scorers of 90th percentile, 95th percentile plus and global do.

37:27
So what you are going to do is replicate that because the technique is very you know, efficiently a proven especially the verbal section and all has been there since ages.

37:36
So the the standard technique to improve in your reading competition is already there.

37:41
What we need to do is understand how to do it and learn technique to how to how to execute it.

37:46
And then you are also going to have some skill building exercises where you are going to learn, you know, inferring meaning, then quantifiers, comparisons, then all all this understanding references all this in 7 and cover.

38:00
So this is actually going to take you around 7 and a half hours of your time.

38:04
So this would in your case would take 3 to 4 working days or maybe a you know, one and a half days in a weekend is going to going to take for master compensation.

38:14
Once master compensation is done, then you go for critical racing.

38:17
So within critical racing again we start with the foundational concept.

38:21
Every CR question has a structure right?

38:22
One paragraph followed by a question, same followed by 5 options.

38:25
That is a standard structure that is ever going to come in your CR.

38:28
There is no other structure for CR apart from this.

38:31
So what are what are those paragraph comprising of?

38:33
Every CR question comprise of the same phenomenon, premise and conclusion.

38:37
So that is what the paragraph is made of.

38:38
Every every CR question we are going to learn more about that.

38:42
So we have 4 files learning models for that and each would be followed up with this, you know quizzes towards the end to assess how much you have learned from it.

38:50
And also you are going to have a journey view.

38:52
Within journey view you are going to see yourself getting compared.

38:55
Now you you compare your performance with the median global population in terms of their first starting scores or first starting scores for each of the file.

39:02
If you are getting grade A, that's indicator that you are doing really Welland if you are getting grade with that means that you are doing at par, you need improvement.

39:08
So you are going to have some pop ups in terms and reviews that you are going to do.

39:12
And if you are getting rate C, that means that you have to redo the complete file once more.

39:16
If this file you are getting a grade C, you are going to redo this complete file once more.

39:21
So that is that is the indicator.

39:23
And there is also another significance of this grading.

39:25
If you are consistently getting an overall, if you see the learning also starts from level zero to Level 3.

39:30
So what happens is we are like, you know, I assume that you would have played games, you know earlier.

39:36
So you would see that the boss fight always comes to the end, right?

39:38
So you that happens because initially when you start, you have to understand the mechanics.

39:44
You have to understand the basic things and then upgrade yourself in terms of your here, in terms of your understanding there, in terms of your tools or techniques or unlocking powers.

39:54
So here what happens is you want to unlock those techniques, unlock the, you know, those learnings from yourself at each level, which is.

40:01
So initially if you are getting say grade C here and grade C here, it will be very surprising to get a grade A here because your quality of learning was poised.

40:11
So your focus is.

40:13
It will be very easy for you to get a grade A here and if you get a grade A here, A here, you are going to have an easy task in getting a grade A here and then it is going to be an easy task to get grade A here and then it will be going to easy task to get a grade A here.

40:26
So it is going to be progressive.

40:27
So you cannot.

40:28
So the another significance is initially when you start your prep say suppose you are at 33rd percentile, you have to go to 94th percentile.

40:35
It does not happen overnight, right?

40:37
It does not happen that you studied for 6 months and the 6 month and day one after that you are going to magically switch to 94.

40:44
Your progress is going to be very you know it is going to happen throughout your journey, right?

40:50
So you are going to see that your progress you are progressing from that 33rd to 50th percentile, then 70th percentile, then 84th percentile, then 94th percentile.

40:59
So you will have a lot of milestones where you would be you know crossing those and then you would have that feedback also.

41:05
What if you spend the whole duration then you realise that it has does not help.

41:10
It is not the time commitment that you are giving, you are also giving your, you know it is not about the money, it is also about the time commitment that you are giving here.

41:17
So which cannot be taken back and you have to apply for round one.

41:21
So once you realise it by June it will be too late.

41:24
You cannot do anything at that point of time.

41:26
So we do not want that to happen.

41:27
You have to have a clear indication of when you are improving and if you are not improving there is a reason.

41:32
So that is why you have a mentor to understand how it works and they they are going to keep track of it and going to give you constant feedbacks in terms of your prep.

41:40
So, so it will be a task basic approach.

41:42
So if you are purchasing the course today, you would get a mentor assigned by tomorrow.

41:45
And So what what would happen is they are going to give you the first set of task to do.

41:50
You are going to finish it there, then they are going to evaluate it, they are going to give you feedbacks and then you are going to go to the next task.

41:54
So it will be task based approach that you are going to proceed.

41:58
And of course it is it is guided by your, this is a framework.

42:01
If you are aware of the concept of framework in a, you know IT, we have this framework, right.

42:05
So this is a framework, but we build your plan on top of that, on top of the framework to if you related to your needs.

42:12
So that is that is how it is going to be.

42:14
And like the way I said, once we cover this, you know, foundation concepts and each other files.

42:22
If you look at each other module, one of the each module is a different type of question.

42:26
The first part initially you would start with concept files.

42:28
So you learn the concepts and the techniques, the DIP centric and all these things would be covered here.

42:33
And then we go for the application files where whatever you have learned is not natural to you.

42:37
You have to make it a muscle memory.

42:39
You have to make sure that that comes as a default technique for you.

42:42
So that we have application files where the objective is only to get the right answer with your given technique in respect of the time that you take.

42:48
Then inference practice file with the time space you have to get the right answer is in the given technique.

42:53
Similarly, each type of question, once you cover each type of questions, you would be navigating through your complete levels like level zero, level one.

43:00
So the course in itself is designed to have tougher topics towards the end of the learning modules.

43:05
So yeah, you will, you will cover Level 3 and then what you do is you are going to go to stage 2.

43:10
Your stage one is done when you go to stage 2.

43:12
So within stage 2, let me I think I have already opened it.

43:16
In stage 2, you are going to take subsection marks.

43:18
You have completed CR, but when you complete CR, you are 33rd percentile based on your quality of learning, you would be in a spectrum.

43:26
So here in this case, you are consistently at a grade A throughout.

43:29
So you would be in a spectrum between 45 percentile to 45th percentile to a 70th percentile.

43:36
That will be the spectrum in stage one.

43:38
So you are currently at 33 from 33.

43:40
Maybe if your quality of learning is really poor in that case, like you have BCBB kind of grade or BBCC kind of grade.

43:48
In that case.

43:49
In that scenario, you would be at the lower end of the spectrum, like you would be at a 45th, 15th percentile.

43:53
But if your quality of learning is good and you are at grade A, So what you would be at a 70th percentile.

43:58
So even if you are at 70th percentile you are not at 20:00, 4th percentile age.

44:02
So to get a 94th percentile you have to have an accuracy of hard accuracy of 80 percentage that should be a threshold.

44:07
In this case the threshold is kept as just one second.

44:11
In this case the threshold is kept as 70 percentage for this student which have copy pasted.

44:16
So in your case will be 80 percentage.

44:19
Initially you would be below that is OK.

44:21
You are going to have a clear idea.

44:22
So this part you have already seen in the video like with NCR within top level, you are going to see what is your accuracy, what is your average correct time, incorrect time based on which you will be doing the course correction and wherever it is required.

44:34
If your mentor is asking you to go back to the course because we capture a lot of data here, we are going to clearly pinpoint what exactly are the cost of inference is your cause of trouble, what is the complete stage one, your mentor is exactly going to tell you the files which maybe you have faltered, maybe you can do better.

44:49
They would ask you to take those files where you are going to take it and make sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.

44:54
Then actually you can come back and create custom quizzes.

44:57
Within custom quizzes you can actually you know just select those particular files and ensure that you are going to make sure that you are going to practice those questions.

45:06
If it is inferential or you have went back, you made sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.

45:10
Now it is your focus on inference to make it cross 80 percentage accuracy.

45:15
So you are going to take inference in custom quizzes and ensure that it is crossing.

45:18
So independently if 3 or 4 weaknesses, they are going to identify independently and make sure that those weakness are dealt with.

45:25
So when you when you isolate your weakness and improve on your weakness, initially your score was being pulled down because of that weakness.

45:31
Once that weakness in itself is about saved your 80 percentage threshold which is which would be yours.

45:36
You want to say that now you are going above the threshold and that is an indicator that you are ready for the next game.

45:41
So you are in a different next session.

45:43
The same happens for reading competition and other sections in quantity as well.

45:46
In quants we have something better like we have something called pace.

45:52
So even when you start from quans, quans is an area which is highly concept like.

45:58
It is high on concepts like unlike verbal and data insights, you would have very minimal concepts to learn.

46:04
But in in quans is an area which have lot of concepts and eventually it is going to take really lot of time to complete the conception.

46:11
So we understand that even when you start maybe you are not that strong but it is not that you do not know anything at all.

46:19
Maybe in the worst case you still know 20% of it 80% you don't know we can accept that.

46:24
So.

46:25
So what we need is at least for the 20% that you have or in some cases you would already know 60 percentage, just 40 percentage you have to learn.

46:33
So we don't want you to waste your time in things which you already know.

46:36
So for that we have something called PACE which is personalised adaptive course engine.

46:40
So what it does is it actually evaluates by you know you are you are understanding you by now you know that each of the modulus type of question.

46:47
So you for for those type of questions you are going to have a diagnostic quiz.

46:53
Within that there will be multiple concepts and all the things which will be covered based on how you perform in the quiz.

46:58
Your average correct time, incorrect time, other pressure, you know the other other pressure graph plots and all this things that we capture and also your activity.

47:06
You are going to recommend only those particular topics where you need to spend your time and going to recommend you to skip the topics which you are already thorough with.

47:14
Here you see 90 to 2 percentage and only 2 files like exponents.

47:18
You are recommended other areas you can skip by.

47:20
So this would give you a guarantee that you don't.

47:22
You don't have to have the fear of missing out.

47:24
Sometimes what happens is see we know that we know it.

47:27
Suppose if you look at say number classification, we know we are aware of number classification but what would eventually happen is we fear of skipping it because we will think OK what if I miss out on something critical.

47:38
So you don't have to have that guilt here.

47:40
You are not missing out on anything critical or anything important that would you know, help you improve your score.

47:46
You are not missing out on anything.

47:47
That is why it is really accurate as well.

47:50
Here you saw 100 percentage and nothing was recommended to skip again.

47:53
But in fractions you saw 100 percentage.

47:54
And then still it is recommending you to take 2 photo of the files because even though you got 100 percentage, maybe your technique of solving in terms of the time taken or other other aspects, maybe these are the 2 files where you can improve your technique after you watch.

48:08
So wherever we have the slightest of the doubt that this area may not be as strong hold for you, you are going to recommend you to take it.

48:14
So eventually you are going to save time for the topics which are already through it and wanna you know.

48:20
So here even though got 100% 4 files are recommended.

48:24
So there there are only 2 files are recommended.

48:26
So here 4 files are recommended depends on the scenario.

48:28
Here also again 100 percentage and here again 100 percentage 2 files are recommended.

48:33
So depending upon that scenario based thing, if you look at say if I take number properties within number properties, yeah, you got 170 percentage, some of the files recommended, some of the files are skipped.

48:49
You can see that here, right?

48:50
So in in this case all the files were recommended for you to take because you have to learn from here.

48:55
There is something you cannot skip anything at all.

48:58
And then divisible to reminders again, everything was recommended.

49:01
You have to take everything and wherever you are strong at here, based on which you got some recommended to skip some you have to take.

49:07
So this is actually, so this is like a fingerprint.

49:11
Your case may not be the same like you have a twin brother with the same capability with the same score and same sectionals also.

49:18
Then also when you come here, maybe this pattern to this deep, it will be different for each of you in terms of the number of hours that you put in a number of studies.

49:27
So that is how it makes a highly customizable and highly personalised study approach.

49:33
And you cannot, you can never expect this in a life class or in terms of a bats kind of class.

49:39
It's not gonna happen because nobody is gonna give you that data or have have this focus.

49:43
So that's something which you're gonna have with this program.

49:47
So yeah.

49:48
OK, now let's let's address your doubts as well.

49:51
So if you have something, you can discuss that also.

49:54
Yep.

49:55
So I think I'm pretty clear about this, how this dashboard is going to work and how this course curriculum is going to work that as I'm pretty sure of.

50:04
So yeah, Yep.

50:06
And I would is there is there any possible can I go some through demo classes or something like that?

50:12
Is it available on Gmail?

50:14
See, we have free trial.

50:16
Have you seen the free trial?

50:18
No, I have not gone through it.

50:20
So you can just share your screen right now and I will help you.

50:25
I'll direct it to you.

50:26
So the free trial, the, you know, approach is I'm I'm aware of that, like how on the GMAT on the e GMAT platform, how that we're going to access that free trial.

50:35
I'm aware of I'm not applying right now because I have I have to be out of India for like one week ahead.

50:42
So that's why I'm not using our free trial is unlimited.

50:45
You don't have to subscribe to it or you don't have to give your card.

50:48
So it's for infinite period of time.

50:50
So the free trial that is seen in our platform, yes.

50:54
So if you can take, I will just show you, if not, I will just tell you verbally.

50:58
Yeah.

50:58
So what what you are going to have is not a systematic learning there.

51:02
You cannot expect from the fundamentals like the way we discussed right learning level 0123, maybe here you are going to directly fight the middle boss.

51:10
So you should not be decided by the difficulty of the topic but rather focus on how they teach.

51:16
Are you comfortable with that teaching approach?

51:19
So that is what your whole idea should be, not to worry about if I am doing well in it or not.

51:24
You don't have to bother about it at this point of time.

51:27
Yeah.

51:28
So that's what happened for about randomly taken the teaching pattern.

51:32
Yeah, yeah.

51:34
So we have a randomly taken sample from verbal quantum DI just for you to understand how we teach.

51:41
Yeah, yeah.

51:44
So if you can just take I will help you with it so that you would get a clear idea of how to take the free trial.

51:49
And in terms of within verbal within points.

51:52
I will tell you about the diagnostic quiz.

51:55
One of the students actually took the diagnostic question just thinking don't we have a lesson?

51:59
It is just a test because the first 2 are diagnostic quiz which the students saw.

52:03
OK, so can you just log into it?

52:08
Can you just sign in with your same Google Google?

53:01
Maybe you can plug in your device maybe because of the power?

53:04
Ohh sorry I didn't get it.

53:12
Maybe you can plug in your device, maybe because of the low power the bandwidth.

53:57
You can close it for the time being.

54:03
You just select with select.

54:04
You know just just select verbal or something quanter bubble or something just click it.

54:14
So here in critical reasoning you don't have to open it.

54:18
I am just I will help you navigate to it.

54:21
Maybe you can press Start learning.

54:22
Just click on Start learning there.

54:27
So on this one, so in introduction itself, we just Scroll down in that right page.

54:34
Just Scroll down.

54:35
You're gonna have videos, you know, here.

54:38
So yeah, got it.

54:44
So so these are the scroll so so so you can see it will be in different ways in different space.

54:51
It will be so maybe for this you are going to have, you know, a page like this or else it will be a different set of page that you navigate through.

54:59
So depending upon the course, by course you are going to have a different structure.

55:03
So all, all, all we have is video lessons which should navigate through and try to understand.

55:08
Are you able to grasp what is being communicated?

55:10
It is the language very clear to you is, is it just, is it communicating, you know, in synchronise with what you expect.

55:18
So you can evaluate on those grounds and then take a call.

55:22
Even for verbal quantities.

55:23
Can you just go back?

55:23
I will just quickly show you the quant as well that you know how you would have to take.

55:38
So within within no, no, do not go back.

55:42
No, you can just go forward.

55:48
OK, So within within number properties, you would first see this diagnostic quest which is there, right?

55:55
You are going to take it and accordingly it is going to recommend you to skip some areas and going to ask you to take some areas.

56:00
But maybe in this scenario you can avoid diagnostic quiz and directly take the concept because of course here we are not planning to.

56:07
So this is diagnostic issue you have selected, right?

56:09
So we can you not take that you can directly start with concept because of course the point of skipping and all these things are there which you can actually do it in the actual platform.

56:19
This is not for saving your time, right?

56:21
This is for you to understand.

56:23
So you do not have to save your time here.

56:25
So you can directly start with concepts and then you can so here you just have to press Start learning the top.

56:38
So just go down everywhere you are going to have videos like this where no, no, just just go up, go up.

56:45
You have to watch this video, then then go to the next files kind of things.

56:49
And then so it will be tutors will be explaining things to you.

56:53
So once you finish it, you can go to the next and just go down.

56:56
Then you will have one small test here understanding it's not if we are not going to capture any data from here just for you understanding.

57:03
Then you go to the next file and towards then you are going to have a test as well.

57:06
So after takeaways you are going to go to the next like down you see Section 2, right Section 2 you are going to have for odd numbers you are going to click there.

57:15
So next you are going to go to the odd numbers then the next the next.

57:18
So you are going to navigate like that here again the video lessons.

57:23
So you are going to watch it and then go to the next.

57:25
So just check it out and let me know.

57:28
Yeah, sure, sure.

57:30
All right so when so you said you would be travelling this street.

57:32
So yeah, yeah maybe towards the mid of mid of Jan is what you are planning to start right?

57:38
Yeah, yeah.

57:39
And I just want to understand like what's the fee structure it is like for the like what's the plan and how it is?

57:45
See for see we have some discounts also running at the moment.

57:49
So see generally you try in a website $399 for 6 months and $299 for 4 months, which is around 34,000 for 6 months and 27,000 for 4 months.

58:04
Yeah, so that is there.

58:06
And since you would be travelling, suppose if you are able to take up free, some free talent depending upon even if you purchased say tomorrow or day after tomorrow does not mean that you have to start on the same day.

58:18
You can actually, actually start after you have visited and all these things you can start, the starting date can be resetted, but you should like to you know, get into that discount price.

58:27
It will be $319 for 6 months, which is 27,000 for.

58:31
