0:02
So far you've not taken any marks.

0:04
The test date that you have in mind is about March and April, so we'll see how long we take to get done with that.

0:11
You're actually looking for top six goals in the US, but if that doesn't happen, but still US is where you want to be.

0:19
And for test prep material from December, you enrolled in the Bouche, but then you know, New Year's came and of course all the party season that happens in your country, you have gotten it frozen, but the subscription is still on.

0:35
When it comes to pain points, you've, you really feel that want is something that you find challenging because you're not able to all the time figure out what exactly the question is asking.

0:45
Verbal is still handleable by you and you feel that DI will not pose a problem as soon as quant and verbal are taken care of.

0:53
So we are right on track with all of that.

0:57
And so now what I'm going to do, , is that I'm going to create a study plan for you, which is going to tell us that how long is it going to take for you to prepare and get to so that score of 685.

1:13
So I'm going to OK, create your study plan and I'm going to share my screen with you right away here.

1:27
And so you'll be able to OK, see my screen.

1:30
I was making this planner for somebody else.

1:33
So let me just go ahead and let's just say delete.

1:40
And so you've not given any mocks.

1:43
No, nothing, right?

1:44
You don't know exactly where your ability stands.

1:47
So OK, let me just no, create a mock study plan for you.

1:50
And let's start a little humble because we know that, you know, maybe we can be in a in a shorter range.

1:57
And so target is 685.

2:00
This we know.

2:02
Yeah, starting ability.

2:03
Where would you say how much percentile would you be in if you were to write a mock right now?

2:15
Maybe I think it will be somewhere between 555 fifty, something like that.

2:23
550 OK, so let's start with 545.

2:26
Let's say that you are at 5:45, which is 43rd percentile and you still need to work your way up.

2:33
Say you took a Sigma X mark and from 5:54 we are moving to 684.

2:39
So we are looking for that 145 forty 140 point improvement, which is absolutely doable.

2:46
No issues on that.

2:48
Now let's say you said, hey, you know what, my verbal is very good.

2:52
So let's keep you to 79 in verbal 1.

2:56
I, I, I get it, but I really don't get it all the single time.

3:01
So let me put it slightly lower on 73 and data insights.

3:07
Let let's keep it at 77.

3:10
OK.

3:10
Is quant too low or is that, does that look OK?

3:13
No, I think, I think it's OK.

3:14
I think it's OK.

3:15
So let's just go with this and let's see.

3:21
So this is where our planner is taking us.

3:24
The planner very well identifies that you are doing pretty well with verbal.

3:29
So to get to that 685, we will take you to 85th verbal, we'll take you to 87 quant and we'll take you to data Insights 80.

3:38
Now as you are progressing in your course  and we see that you have come to a point where you are able to handle data insights well or we can push you a little bit more in verbal.

3:50
Then what what we would try to do is that decrease that pressure of getting to Q87 from you so that we can actually leverage on your strength and push you where the the scores are coming more easily for us rather than you know kind of working really hard to really get to that Q87.

4:11
OK, So these scores are dynamic.

4:15
We will change it according to the performance that you do while you are on the course.

4:21
Makes sense.

4:21
OK, Yeah.

4:23
OK.

4:24
So let's move on now.

4:25
We will take subsectional scores also if we are looking at D85, then sorry V-85, then where is that 85 coming from?

4:37
Whether we are, we need to target more on your CR or whether on RC again depending upon the idea is to leverage on your strengths as much as we can.

4:46
So we are looking at that you know, almost 6 point improvement in verbal.

4:52
The the youth, the largest improvement that we are looking at isn't quant definitely that's 14 points and data insights just about 3 points.

5:00
So now when you've seen verbal already for some time now, are you better than CR or better than RC?

5:07
What would you say RC?

5:12
I think RC are better than CRD.

5:13
Yeah.

5:14
OK, so let's take it to say about, OK, it won't go beyond 58, so I'm just going to keep it there and let's just see that I keep it over here for CR.

5:25
OK, let's work with that.

5:30
So 4.3 weeks for that and let's proceed in.

5:37
I think right now this question won't make much sense, so let's just stick to this, whatever optimum we are getting from the planner, OK, so 5.6 weeks now, 5.6 weeks is coming from the fact that you're putting 20 weeks per hour Monday through Friday, you're giving two hours because then you're working and Saturday, Sunday because you're off, you're thinking that you could do at least five hours of study.

6:03
So 10 hours coming from the weekdays and 10 hours coming from your weekend.

6:06
That's making it 20 hours and OK, makes sense.

6:10
Alrighty.

6:11
And then when we go to proceed it start with this.

6:15
It'll keep our DI.

6:19
Let's see here.

6:22
Let's see here MSR, we can take chance with this.

6:27
OK, So about 4.6 weeks.

6:32
So 6 + 6 plus almost 5.

6:35
That's what I'm looking at.

6:36
OK, let's.

6:37
So we are going to start with verbal and then we are going to take you to quant and then DI.

6:45
DI will always be your last section because as you said, either they are asking map based question or non map based questions.

6:52
Once you're done with both of them, handing them would be easier.

6:56
This is the time commitment that the planner is taking.

6:59
Do you think that you'll be able to stick to this?

7:03
Yeah, yeah, maybe I'll maybe I'll study more in Saturday and Sunday, but I think it's OK.

7:08
Five hours both and two hours during the week.

7:10
I think's OK.

7:11
Yeah.

7:11
OK.

7:12
So, yeah, so you will get that option to increase anytime in case you can study more.

7:18
So we will look into that as well.

7:20
Now, Fernando, your day has already started.

7:23
You must have plans for today.

7:25
Suppose if you start starting from tomorrow, you know like you fix that schedule that OK, these two hours are coming gonna come from here, then when we will be able to take the test Actually it will take you to may end of Yeah, because that's the kind of time we require unless we increase time over here.

7:46
But since you would be working, I would suggest not to burn your candle on both sides.

7:52
It's OK because the schools will only open their round one somewhere in July.

8:00
So if you're yeah, if you're getting done with your test by 28 May still you will OK have to put 45454045 days to work on your application and the and the deadline is only on September.

8:13
So I think I correct the deadline.

8:15
I have more time exactly.

8:17
That also makes a lot of sense that the deadline is also gonna be in September.

8:21
So rather than let's just focus on the first thing first, which is Gmail test.

8:25
Get that done with, let's get that good score and then we can start worrying about our application.

8:35
OK, so let's just accept all these suggestions that's coming from the study plan.

8:41
And now I'm going to show you what your calendar looks like.

8:44
So this is what your calendar is going to look like.

8:46
You're going to spend some 7 hours in an additional course other than CRNRC, which we have in verbal.

8:52
And I'll tell you why we have an extra course and what you need to do in that.

8:56
Then your verbal will start with stage 1.

8:59
So every single subsection you will complete in two stages, Stage 1 and stage 2.

9:06
So RC also is happening in Stage 1 and in stage 2.

9:11
Once both the subsections are done, then we will take you to verbal test readiness, which is nothing but sectional mocks.

9:18
So now we're going to put together everything and we're going to see your ability, whether you're getting to that target score that study planner has set for you.

9:24
Quant is going to be the same thing.

9:26
You're going to start with some basics and then our and let me take you to the course over here.

9:34
Hear you understand it better.

9:35
So verbal apart from CR and RC, we have an extra course, which is master comprehension, which appears as MC in your course.

9:43
I'm gonna talk about it.

9:43
What what it is Quant Quant basics It is.

9:47
First we will go through the quant basics to understand that OK, what are the basic concepts that are tested on Gmap and how do they work?

9:55
Then number properties, word problems, and advanced topics are the three topics under arithmetic.

10:04
So little tedious, but these are the three sections in arithmetic and algebra is just algebra.

10:10
There are fewer topics over here, so we can cover it all by itself.

10:14
Data insights.

10:15
All the four sections that you are aware of, they are all covered pretty comprehensively.

10:20
One thing that remains constant throughout the three sections are the three stages of learning, which is the basic architecture of teaching at EG math.

10:31
In stage one we teach you all the concepts and the processes.

10:35
In stage 2 we take you to medium and hard level questions where you work on your accuracy and you know, cementing your process that you have learned in stage 1.

10:47
And finally, we take you to test readiness where we'll we give you sectional marks just to make sure that you are getting to the target which the planner has set for you.

10:58
Once everything is done right at the last week of the test of of your preparation, we are just going to give you 4 full length marks.

11:07
So in on GMAT, we have on at egmap platform, we have 5 mops altogether.

11:15
The first one is free of cost for you.

11:17
You can take it even before purchasing the course.

11:20
This just helps us create your own personalized study plan because then we can get to know what is your starting ability.

11:27
OK, so then we will know whether it's really you are at 4:45 or maybe you you could be a little higher than that, maybe you're really doing OK, things like that.

11:36
And So what will happen is that if you score more than the days taken in, the planner is also gonna come.

11:43
Yeah.

11:44
So probably we will not have to wait till May end to write the test.

11:47
Maybe we would be able to write the test in second week of May, who knows?

11:50
Then we would have more time to work on our application.

11:53
So that's the whole purpose of it.

11:55
But the last four mocks we will reserve till the end of your course preparation so that just before you book your test, we will put you into that momentum of writing one mock every single day so that you can decide on your section.

12:08
You can feel the exam anxiety, how much it's coming and bothering you or your you're comfortable with your test, so on and so forth.

12:15
OK, so OK, all the planning related to the real test will happen during your mocks, which is the last stage of your studies.

12:24
OK, so now when we wait, I just need to move this far here.

12:35
OK, so now let's go to our course.

12:39
If I show you your planner, according to your planner, the first thing you're starting is with MC course, which is Master comprehensions.

12:48
And so in Master comprehension course, Master comprehension is nothing, but it's a skill building course.

12:56
It's an additional course which is not tested under GMAT, but , by the way, I am a senior verbal SME at EGMAP.

13:04
I've been working with GMAP for the last 13 1/2 years and I'm primarily a verbal SME, but now I doubled up as a strategist as well.

13:13
So you know, when we created our CR and that time SCRC and CR, all the three courses, we realized that there's a lot of reading and understanding that you have to do in the world of verbal.

13:25
And so we thought that my not to teach our students the first thing first, which is how to read properly.

13:31
Because if we don't read properly, then we do not engage with the passage well.

13:37
And if we don't engage with the passage well, then of course, you know, there is a snowball effect and then we can't actually answer our questions.

13:45
So the idea of this core building skill course is that we teach you how to read in small, small chunks so that you read and comprehend at the same time, basically making you an active leader.

13:57
When you become an active leader, your understanding of the passive increases by 80%.

14:02
That's the first thing.

14:03
The second thing that happens is that your retention is more because you have been actively reading everything in the passage.

14:09
So you remember, OK, I read this, I read that.

14:11
And the third thing that happens is your recall is faster because you have been that engaged and then your recall improves.

14:20
Then what happens is that you don't have to go back to passage and really did to answer every single question.

14:27
That means saving a huge amount of time on exam.

14:32
And this skill will come very, very handy in DI also because DI questions are super lengthy to read.

14:38
They're just very, very verbose.

14:41
And then once you become a manager too, the skill will come when you will come handy when you start reading, say, news reports and you know, case studies on at your job.

14:54
So a life skill to get.

14:57
Now let's start with Verbal.

15:00
OK, so in verbal for both CR and RC, our first module is the Foundation Concepts.

15:08
In CR, the first thing that we do is we teach you how to identify a conclusion in in ACR argument because that's the most important part of the argument because most of the questions centered around conclusion.

15:23
Once you learn that the following modules map to the kind of CR questions that you face on G Nat, which are six types inference, assumption, evaluates, trend, then beacon and boldface.

15:37
These are the major categories that we look at, OK?

15:42
So after that, we basically we tell our students to focus more on module and assumptions because if these two modules you're able to master inference will help you master strengthen and weaken because they are nothing but inference questions with a little specificity that OK, find the strengthener for the conclusion or find the weakener for the.

16:03
So these are all inferences, but nothing else.

16:05
And then if you learn whatever you're learning in assumptions, that will help you answer, evaluate and boldface.

16:12
You just need the same skills.

16:13
So assumption will fill that up for you.

16:16
And So what do we have in inference?

16:18
There are 14 lessons now.

16:21
They are not randomly put there.

16:23
There is a structure to every module.

16:25
Also three parts to every module.

16:28
In the first part of the module, you learn all the necessary concepts that you need to know to answer inference questions correctly.

16:36
And mind you, out of these 14 files, only 5 are lessons.

16:41
Rest all the 9 are nothing but quiz files.

16:44
Yes they are quiz practice files right?

16:48
And in fact every single lesson also they start with a small quiz and they end with a mini quiz to make sure.

16:56
Basically to give you the feedback as to how well you have learned that particular lesson like we would have in school.

17:02
You know they would administer on small tests just like that.

17:06
OK.

17:07
The second part of the module is the application file where we teach you the three-step process to solve every single CR question.

17:15
And then we take you to the practice files where you marry the applications with the concepts and now apply them on GMAP light question.

17:25
With every next practice file that you move on to, the questions start becoming complicated more.

17:32
And so we basically we are working on your ability to 1st apply concepts and application on easier questions, then on medium questions and then on part questions.

17:43
Do you have any questions at this point?

17:45
 No, no.

17:47
Looks OK Makes sense.

17:49
Looks OK, makes sense.

17:50
OK, so now you can see that there are certain score against each and every lesson that we have.

17:57
These are all scores of your quizzes that you would be attempting in every lesson.

18:02
Now you may ask, hey, what is a good score?

18:05
Do I need to get 100% in every single file?

18:08
No, not really.

18:10
Just stay above the median.

18:12
Then you will be good and then you can ask me, OK, So what is the median score?

18:17
So right now we are looking at the course in the modules where there is something called Journey view.

18:23
Also when we do the journey view, we don't see the modules, we see the learning lessons and we see that we get grades over here.

18:30
OK, so if you click on Foundation CR and you click on activity performance, the first foundation module and the inference module are part of this.

18:41
And if you check the median score over here, everything is mentioned here.

18:47
If you score more than the median, that's when you get grade A.

18:53
If you score equal to the median, you get grade B.

18:57
Anything below the median will get you grade C, which is a big red flag.

19:02
If you get grade C, What you need to do is look at the question that you got wrong.

19:07
Look at the solution, compare it with your process that what you did to get the answer wrong.

19:12
If needed, go back to that pertinent portion in that video lesson where that particular topic has been taught so that you know what mistake you made and you know how to fix it.

19:23
So that when you move on to the next lesson and attempt the next quiz, you do not make the same mistake.

19:30
But do you think that do you think that in this moment where I'm still learning and doing this first quizzes, I should get concerned about the time that I take him to answer the question I or should concern about getting it right, getting it right?

19:44
Because you will see none of our questions are timed.

19:47
None of our quizzes are timed anyway, so that's a very good question to ask .

19:53
Stage one, we will only focus on learning things the right way and getting to that accuracy.

20:01
We are not working on time time.

20:03
We will work on Stage 2 and Stage 3.

20:06
Nice OK right and and you will find that none of these quizzes have any time timer on them.

20:11
You can take as long as you want, but we want you to get those grade A's.

20:16
So grades, that's why we are looking at try to take get as many A's as possible.

20:21
OK, so this is where you can come and check how much grade have you gotten?

20:25
And there you need help Now, , if you decide to come on on board, EG Mat, you will be provided a mentor with whom you can communicate through emails.

20:35
Say if you get stuck with, you know, grade C in one of the files or two of the files, and you say, hey, I was doing pretty good.

20:42
Could you just take a look at those two lessons and my quizzes and let me know why did I score grade C?

20:49
Because I'm really not able to wrap my head around it and tell me what's the what's the solution to get back up to grade A again?

20:57
So they will help you navigate through the course also.

21:01
OK, OK.

21:01
And so come, we'll come back to that.

21:04
This is the way you will finish inference assumption evaluates from then and all of that, you know, and as you keep moving, the modules will start getting shorter and shorter because most of the things you have already covered in inference and assumption.

21:17
So rest of them just introduction to these type of question and nothing else, but just get getting into the practice of all of that.

21:26
OK, then we have the last module for you, some miscellaneous kind of questions that you may see here and there, but we we just have it so that you're at least familiar with that.

21:36
Once this module is done, you have spent enough time, about 41 hours on your CR stage 1.

21:45
Stage 1 is done.

21:47
Any questions before I take you to stage C?

21:50
Stage two?

21:51
No, no, it's OK.

21:53
OK.

21:53
Mm hmm.

21:54
Now it's time to work on your accuracy and timing both.

22:02
OK, now we will come to the timed quiz where we will see whether the process has become intuitive to you or not.

22:09
So this is our quizzing platform which we call Scholaranium.

22:14
We are at Verbal Scholaranium.

22:15
Now you have just finished your CR course and now we will take you to our stage 2 which we call cementing quizzes.

22:23
Cementing quizzes have been have been divided into two parts Medium cementing and hard cementing.

22:30
So how do we clear medium cementing?

22:32
We ask you to take 5 quizzes.

22:35
These quizzes are short ones, five to six questions each, not nothing too demanding.

22:40
So we ask you to take 5 quizzes and at least three of them must have 70% or more accuracy.

22:50
That's your threshold to get past three.

22:53
And these are timed quizzes mind you.

22:55
So we will look into your accuracy as well, your timing aspect as well.

23:00
OK, once you get the, then once we get that graph that OK, we see three dots over this broken green line.

23:07
We know you have cleared your medium cementing.

23:10
You are ready to move on to your hard cementing.

23:13
Now questions will become harder.

23:15
Mind you, , we are looking at 685, which is 96 percentile and in order to get to that score, we actually need to face more medium and harder questions.

23:27
Easier questions will not cut it for us.

23:30
OK, so it's important that we get accuracy in our medium and hard questions.

23:34
OK, then we take you to hard, hard cementing again the same drill 5 quizzes, but three, at least three must have more than 55% accuracy.

23:47
So again, above the dotted line we you need to see three dots at least over here for your OK cementing to be done.

23:56
So this way you would have done 50, sorry 10 quizzes over here, about 50 to 60 questions.

24:05
Only in stage 260 questions are good enough to get that process cemented that you are that you have learnt in stage 1.

24:14
Think about when you went, you know, maybe say driving.

24:18
You know, there were so many things to work on the first day.

24:21
Hand eye coordination, look at your mirrors, look at your rearview mirror, maintain your lane.

24:26
Not swirling around here with a lot.

24:28
But you know, once you started driving more and more and more, you started with a small empty parking lot.

24:33
Then we started going onto our local roads and finally onto the highways.

24:37
So we built up our ability slowly.

24:39
That's exactly what we are doing in stage one.

24:42
We will give you all the ability to navigate when we bring you to Scholaranium.

24:47
Here we are letting you lose first in your in your city streets and then taking you to the hub.

24:54
That's OK Nice of doing this.

24:56
OK.

24:56
Now once your CR is done, we will go back to the course and we will finish our reading comprehension in exactly the same manner.

25:05
Our first module is very, very important over here where you learn strategies, how to remain engaged even with the harder passages with certain strategies.

25:15
It's like note taking, looking at the keywords, following the transition, and following what the author is trying to tell us through this passage.

25:25
OK, this is the most important one over here.

25:28
Make sure that you you get all the grade grades A over here.

25:33
And then the next 4-1 are the four different kinds of RC questions that you see.

25:38
Nothing too much to worry about over here.

25:41
These are really shorter concepts we just introduce you to OK, this is how detailed question are worded.

25:48
This is where you need to work on if your detailed question comes and other steps related to that.

25:54
Then we will bring you to the application file of RC where we will serve you 9 passages starting with four easy, then taking you to 5 medium and we will round up stage one with seven hard passages.

26:10
SO16 passages starting from easy ending with hard in your first stage as well.

26:18
OK, OK, once again, criteria is there.

26:21
Stay above medium.

26:23
Get grade A in all of these.

26:26
OK, once this is done, it's time to move on to Stage 2 and Stage 2.

26:31
Once again, the cementing criteria throughout every subsection remain the same.

26:38
For medium 3, cementing with 70% or more, hard cementing at least three of them with 55% or that's all we require.

26:46
OK, Once you have done that also for RC, you've solved some 100 to 140 questions only in your Stage 2 combining CR and RC.

26:55
Now it's time to take you to Stage 3 of verbal, which is sectional mock.

27:01
So we will give you only the verbal sectional mock 45 minutes, 23 questions.

27:06
Let's see how far, how close we we have come to the target set by our planner.

27:11
OK, OK.

27:12
And yeah, So there are 50 sectional box all across the board, 15 for DI, 15 for verbal and 15 for content, 5 here and there.

27:22
So we have ample mock tests, sectional mock tests to Ray Tube.

27:27
Any questions?

27:29
No, no, makes sense.

27:31
Really, really clear.

27:32
Oh, OK, so now we will.

27:34
So now that your verbal is over, we will get you started with quant and your drill will remain absolutely the same.

27:42
You will first go through stage one in quant, Quant basics.

27:49
Here we will just help you brush up a simple, some simple concepts that you might see going forward.

27:59
Now I want to talk about one feature that we have only in our contours, nowhere else.

28:05
It's called Pace View engine.

28:07
Now Pace View Engine what because point course is very tedious.

28:11
We have 3 sections only for arithmetic and they are pretty long thing.

28:15
And let me take you to one of those over there say word problem.

28:19
There are already so many modules over here, at least eight of them, OK?

28:25
And they are pretty longer modules.

28:27
So what we have done is that in order order to make sure that you don't spend time doing everything in the course and only work on that requires your attention, we have put diagnostic quizzes right at the beginning of every single module.

28:44
So there is a concept diagnostic and there is AG Map skill diagnostic.

28:49
Go ahead, give that diagnostic and let the system decide what needs your attention and what does not need your attention.

28:58
So only focus on what requires your focus.

29:02
You don't have to do things that you're already good at.

29:05
So this will customize your or personalize your one force more for you so that you can move faster.

29:11
So this is how you will move through the entire one course.

29:16
One basic first, then number properties Stage 1, stage two, word problem Stage 1, Stage 2, advanced topic Stage 1 and Stage 2, and Algebra Stage 1 and stage 2 Stage 2.

29:28
So by the time you finish everything over here in stage 2, you would have actually solved some 240 to 260 questions through these cementing quizzes, hard and medium and single section questions.

29:47
So so yeah, I, I'm on this understanding that it's better for me to focus on one section first, finish it, study all that it has in verbal, then I finish that then then I go to quant and I think in the future when I'm almost taking the test, I will just take questions and see where are my gaps.

30:06
So this is the suggestion here, right?

30:09
Yeah.

30:09
OK.

30:10
That's that's what we always believe.

30:12
And each EG Matt, that you, because DI, I mean verbal and quant, they have two very different skill sets.

30:20
Yeah.

30:21
And if you're think about it, if you're only giving two hours every single day to study and if you say, OK, one hour, I'll do this, one hour I'll I will do that.

30:31
Your mind will like take time, yeah, to switch gears from 1:00 to another and you won't be able to learn anything in one go.

30:39
So we are focusing on let's just get this done once and for all, then we keep it aside.

30:45
It's like learning your taking your piano lessons all in, you know, 30 days.

30:50
So that when you're focusing totally on that, you develop that muscle memory so that even if you don't get to play for too long, once you sit and touch that key, those keys, you know how to play, it becomes that intuitional for you, right?

31:05
So this is what we are doing.

31:07
However, because you would be spending almost 5 weeks or almost six weeks on your quant, every single week, we will administer a verbal mock for you so that you still keep in touch with everything that you have learned in verbal.

31:24
So you will not go out of practice when you are doing verbal.

31:27
In the same way, when you come to DI, we will now give you a verbal mock also and we will give you a quant mock also.

31:34
So say Saturday you will do verbal, Sunday you will do quant and you will prepare for for your DI as well.

31:39
Again, keeping you in touch with everything that you have learned.

31:43
Makes sense.

31:43
OK, Yeah, makes nice.

31:45
OK, so with this now this is this is when when you finish your quant preparation again, sexual mocks, we will give you 45 minutes, 21 questions.

31:58
Let's see how much we have improved and whatever little round UPS needed to be there, it would be done at this stage only.

32:05
Once this is done again, we will go back to our course.

32:09
Data insights, same thing, data sufficiency.

32:12
Stage 1.

32:13
Stage 2.

32:14
Gita Stage 1, Stage 2, TPA, MSR both individually.

32:18
Stage 1.

32:19
Stage 2.

32:20
So when you finish your stage 2 from DI again, the same number of questions you would have solved over here, 240 to 250 months.

32:29
OK, so everything would be done over here.

32:32
Once again we will give you sectional mark just for DI, just to check how much you have learned, what else is required.

32:39
Once all of that is done, that's when towards the last leg of your preparation, just the last week, we will start giving you one walk after the other.

32:49
You can decide OK, this combination of order is working for me.

32:53
Two hours is sitting for exam getting too much on me, Am I OK with everything, when to take my break, when to do thing, what time of the day shall I go and get my exams that I'm at my optimum to write everything down and so on so forth.

33:06
So all those things we will decide over this period of time and I'm showing you a score of somebody who's very similar with you in your skills.

33:18
, you told me, hey, shut that, you know, I I would be somewhere around 55545.

33:23
This girl was also at 555 when she started her course.

33:26
She was aiming at 695.

33:29
Within two months, she was able to achieve 695.

33:32
This is her real score on GMAP as well.

33:36
So she did get 140 point improvement.

33:39
I will share her success story with you.

33:41
So that Leela, that's her name if I show you the course.

33:45
Hello Leela.

33:46
That's what it says, right?

33:47
So I'm gonna share her success story with you.

33:50
And so yeah, she actually made that 140 point progress in two months time.

33:55
You are giving us four to five months.

33:57
Absolutely doable , even with a full time job that you are doing.

34:02
OK, nice.

34:03
I'm pretty much done showing everything that I had to show here.

34:08
Now I'm ready to answer any questions that you may have from me.

34:13
No, I think my questions you, you already answered during during that time.

34:18
So I think I'm comfortable.

34:20
I just want to understand now that we've made a plan, where do I see it?

34:24
How do how do I see it?

34:25
Where do I look?

34:27
And I just want to get started.

34:29
OK.

34:29
If you wanna get started, , what I will do is that I can share the link of this study plan with you right away on the WhatsApp.

34:40
But make sure that you access this planner only when you're logged into your account.

34:47
OK.

34:47
Wow.

34:47
OK.

34:48
Yeah.

34:48
OK.

34:48
That's when it's going to work.

34:50
Otherwise it will not because you know you have not purchased the course and it is not made in your paid account.

34:57
So here you are.

35:02
I have shared the PSP with you already.

35:05
Now if I'm looking at the PSP, let me share my screen so that you know what I'm talking about here.

35:14
OK.

35:14
So 545 to 685, it's taking us about four months, OK, June, July, sorry, Feb, March, April and May.

35:27
So it's exactly taking us four months.

35:30
So I would say, , that you can buy a four month course from EG MAT to keep your subscription on for all those days.

35:40
And then you can always go for a one week extension or whatever it is.

35:45
You know that we can work out later if we want to keep that subscription on till 28th of May that we'll figure out how to do.

35:53
But yeah, I would suggest that a four month plan is what will work for you at this point in time if you were to buy this program, this is this will cost you 299, OK, 99 US pharma plan, 299 USD.

36:13
OK, nice.

36:15
Yes.

36:16
And I've already shared your a planner with you.

36:19
If you plan to take your as you were telling me over the text that, hey, you know, I'll look into some of the sections.

36:26
And then over the weekend, I want to do my mock test as well.

36:30
So once you write your mock test, just leave me a message that, hey, shut, I've done my mock test.

36:35
Then what I will do is that I will create your planner on your real scores.

36:41
OK, nice.

36:42
Yeah.

36:42
And then you will have the real scores with your real target, everything because here I've just put in some, you know, imaginary numbers for you given that.

36:52
OK, this is you're, you're good in verbal, not so good in quantum, kinda OK ish in data itself.

36:57
But once you give me the mock test, mock test scores, then I will create the real planner for you and then I'll share share it with you.

37:04
But right now you can keep it for reference to just see that, OK, this is how every day will go and this is how what I'm going to put my course makes sense.

37:13
Perfect.

37:14
All righty , any other questions that you may have?

37:18
Just a question.

37:19
I'm coming from Brazil.

37:20
Do you think that the 685 is a good is a good score for me to a because I know that there's a little bit different is if the person from USA from Europe.

37:29
I think it it has a variety.

37:32
I think the 685 is OK, right.

37:35
Yes, 685 is absolutely a perfect score for you don't because a lot of Indians also give GMAP Yeah.

37:42
So we tell them also that, you know, at least aim for 685.

37:46
I would never encourage you to go anything be below this.

37:50
Let's at least aim for 685 and then let's work towards it and let's see where, where, where do we go.

37:56
But at least 86685 is a good score.

37:59
It's a very comfortable score.

38:00
I mean, if if I get 6685, I'm gonna go and sleep.

38:04
I'm not gonna worry too much about.

38:06
It's OK.

38:07
Yeah, it's OK.

38:07
Absolutely.

38:09
OK.

38:09
All right.

38:11
OK.

38:11
So really clear.

38:13
Thank you for your time and for explaining me all of that.

38:16
I think I'll.

38:18
It will help me a lot.

38:19
My preparation time.

38:21
Sure.

38:21
Thank you.

38:22
Thank you, .

38:22
Whatever you decide, just let me know you have my phone number.

38:26
Whenever you're done with my mock, just let me know and then we can.

38:31
OK?

38:32
Thank you.

38:33
All righty.

38:34
Have a great rest of your day.

38:35
Bye for now.

38:36
For you too.

38:36

38:37
