0:12
Hello.
Speaker: agent

0:13
Hello.
Speaker: prospect

0:13
Hi, Amruth.
Speaker: prospect

0:14
How are you?
Speaker: agent

0:15
Hey, Siddh, I'm good.
Speaker: agent

0:16
Thanks for asking.
Speaker: agent

0:17
How are you?
Speaker: agent

0:18
I'm good, I'm good, Right.
Speaker: prospect

0:20
So Sudharth, before we start, have you taken any mocks yet?
Speaker: agent

0:26
, just just wanted to check.
Speaker: agent

0:28
Yeah, I've taken one of the mock.
Speaker: prospect

0:30
So diagnostic, diagnostic test of the mv.com that the first mock that we get.
Speaker: prospect

0:34
No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker: agent

0:37
So that I have taken OK, you you have taken that.
Speaker: agent

0:41
And how was your score?
Speaker: agent

0:43
It was 425 something 425 is it?
Speaker: prospect

0:48
Yeah, correct.
Speaker: prospect

0:49
OK, OK.
Speaker: agent

0:50
So what's your target score?
Speaker: agent

0:52
And you know what, what is it that you're planning in terms of?
Speaker: agent

0:58
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

0:59
OK.
Speaker: prospect

0:59
So firstly I'm, I'm just started to think about doing MBA firstly.
Speaker: prospect

1:05
And the main reason that I choosing GMAT over CAT is that I'm already, I'm already having a good amount of like I'm getting a good salary.
Speaker: prospect

1:14
What if I'm working so far?
Speaker: prospect

1:16
So it doesn't make any sense to do MVA from India because I, I will have a yeah, average package of that much only.
Speaker: prospect

1:22
So that's why.
Speaker: prospect

1:24
So that's the reason.
Speaker: prospect

1:26
And and I started the GMAT I have I'm like I'm I got I went to all the resources and all GMAT club and such all things.
Speaker: prospect

1:33
I am kind of confused right now first thing is that like, you know, am I too late for the applying for the GMAT or something like that?
Speaker: prospect

1:40
I have a work experience of around 2.5 years 2.5 right.
Speaker: prospect

1:45
How how it will be late like in terms of see the round one application for anyways this year application is mostly close.
Speaker: agent

1:53
So correct, correct.
Speaker: prospect

1:54
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

1:55
So you you starting at a 425, it's not that sensible to look for one month or 2 month program.
Speaker: agent

2:01
So yeah, it have to have your time.
Speaker: agent

2:03
And what you have thought about like June to September.
Speaker: agent

2:07
So September would be the deadline for most of the school.
Speaker: agent

2:10
So a score in the month of July would help.
Speaker: agent

2:14
June, July at least in the starting of July or end of June is something which you can look for taking the test.
Speaker: agent

2:20
So whether with the 6 months of prep is what you need to look at.
Speaker: agent

2:24
And you should be looking if you are looking outside India, you should be looking for a score of you know 6957 not 5 plus see you know you would see in most of the schools written 71072730.
Speaker: agent

2:37
So those are classic edition.
Speaker: agent

2:40
So we had classic edition first and now it's focus edition.
Speaker: agent

2:43
So the test has changed.
Speaker: agent

2:45
So the people have taken classic edition in 2020 their their course is still valid till 2025.
Speaker: agent

2:51
They can apply the schools with that score itself.
Speaker: agent

2:53
So that's why most of the schools have, you know, this aspect covered or you know, the the scores which they mentioned the website to is to include them as well.
Speaker: agent

3:05
So they have not changed it maybe from 2026 you will see the focus edition specific target schools, target scores for this schools.
Speaker: agent

3:13
So yeah, if you are looking at the top schools like in CR Paris, say Howard, Stanford, if you are looking for the top schools, that median is at 6:00, 85 kind of score.
Speaker: agent

3:22
So you should be looking at 30 point on top of that.
Speaker: agent

3:24
So it will not be the median range, it will be, you know, I arranged a 77 and 5 could be a good score to chase.
Speaker: agent

3:32
You know, in terms of your prep together 7 and 5 you have to have a total sum of.
Speaker: agent

3:39
I hope you are aware of GMAT structure.
Speaker: agent

3:42
Are you?
Speaker: prospect

3:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

3:43
I have gone through all the structure and all.
Speaker: prospect

3:45
So I am pretty much aware about the GMAT Focus edition and how it is different from the classic edition.
Speaker: prospect

3:50
So I am pretty good aware of that, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

3:52
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

3:52
So the scale score start from 60 to 90, V 60 to V 90, D 60 to D 90 and Q 60 to Q 90.
Speaker: agent

4:01
And what you need to get as 715 is the sum of score of 256 is what you need to get as 715.
Speaker: agent

4:09
So irrespective of which combination you look at, you have to get a, you know 2256 that that's what you are going to cheat.
Speaker: agent

4:18
Yeah, OK.
Speaker: agent

4:18
So that being said, So what we are going to look at is or maybe in this call itself, I will create a plan and show it to you so that you would understand how many hours on verbal content.
Speaker: agent

4:29
Yeah, you're gonna put.
Speaker: agent

4:31
But apart from that, you know, just wanted to ask how did you hear about us?
Speaker: agent

4:36
Sorry, Easy.
Speaker: agent

4:36
And what how did you hear about easy?
Speaker: agent

4:38
I I went to the YouTube modus, most of the channels.
Speaker: prospect

4:42
So yeah, that's all I went to.
Speaker: prospect

4:44
OK, OK, OK, OK.
Speaker: agent

4:46
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: agent

4:47
So generally we get a lot of students coming through our own existing students.
Speaker: agent

4:51
So that's what I was just checking if that's the case.
Speaker: agent

4:53
OK, All right, so that's OK.
Speaker: agent

4:56
So what are the things that I would like to understand in this call so that we can accordingly discuss?
Speaker: agent

5:01
OK, sure.
Speaker: prospect

5:02
So I'm kind of like kind of not sure, like, you know, because I was, I was going through videos and a lot of people like, you know, the starting point where something 525 or something and I'm almost way too low from 425.
Speaker: prospect

5:16
So that's the pretty much confusion that, you know, like am I way too low scoring that way?
Speaker: prospect

5:22
And apart from that, how this structure will be working because I will have a I will be working during this whole time and definitely I will be looking forward to do this.
Speaker: prospect

5:31
Applying is for the September round.
Speaker: prospect

5:33
So definitely I will be looking forward to around what?
Speaker: prospect

5:36
Yeah, June, July, I will be ready to give the test.
Speaker: prospect

5:39
So that's what I'm targeting right now.
Speaker: prospect

5:41
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

5:43
So do you have this course open right now?
Speaker: agent

5:46
Can you just take the scores?
Speaker: agent

5:48
OK.
Speaker: prospect

5:48
Just 425.
Speaker: prospect

5:50
Yeah, just accordingly we will create a plan.
Speaker: agent

5:52
OK, sure, sure.
Speaker: prospect

5:52
Just give me a minute.
Speaker: prospect

5:53
I will just let you.
Speaker: prospect

5:57
Meanwhile, I am just sharing my screen.
Speaker: agent

6:00
Yeah, you can just dictate your scores to me.
Speaker: agent

6:05
Once you take it, let me know.
Speaker: agent

6:06
OK.
Speaker: prospect

6:07
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

6:12
See it is all about irrespective of the starting point, what matters is how long it is going to take.
Speaker: agent

6:18
See irrespective of the scores that you get, what we are actually more keen on is to understand how long it is going to take because GMAT is a very has a very defined syllabus.
Speaker: agent

6:28
So one of the key elements of GMAT is we have a very defined syllabus and you are going to get questions on it from those type of questions.
Speaker: agent

6:34
The type of questions are also limited in terms of verbal content di.
Speaker: agent

6:38
So that is one of the reasons why you see most of the prep programs are limited to 6 months because if you are taking more than 6 months to 7 months for GMAT, that means that you are doing things wrong somewhere.
Speaker: agent

6:51
Maybe your study was not in the right direction, you had a lot of gaps in terms of your prep, maybe you have not studied everyday.
Speaker: agent

6:57
So a lot of factors would account for it if if there is an extension beyond that.
Speaker: agent

7:03
So because you know when, when a very different topic is there, it is like, you know, just for example, your test in your, you know, bachelors, the OR, or in your school, you have a syllabus, you are going to finish it in one point of time or the other.
Speaker: agent

7:16
Even if you are someone who is at a really low score and you are in the failing category of out of 100, you are getting 10 in your test does not mean that you are never going to hit 100, right?
Speaker: agent

7:27
It is not, does not mean that you are never going to hit in IT.
Speaker: agent

7:29
It is all about how you prepare yourself to get to that 90.
Speaker: agent

7:32
You have to learn from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

7:34
You have to do a lot of fundamental study within our platform, which is so our course is also really comprehensive.
Speaker: agent

7:39
So the difference between you and someone who is starting at the 535 years.
Speaker: agent

7:43
I can also show you one of the confidence students studying at a 55 in 3 months go to a store of 715555 have gone to a 765 in around 4 months.
Speaker: agent

7:54
In your case the 3 months from 425 to 7 15 May not be that realistic.
Speaker: agent

8:00
But of course double the time you know 4 to around 5 to 6 months and one other aspect is to go from 425 to 555 like they are starting point you are going to get faster because the learning curve towards the initial you know the span of score improvement during the initial phase of score improvement is going to be easy.
Speaker: agent

8:20
300 to 400 is easy then going from 400 to 500 correct.
Speaker: agent

8:25
And so going from this 500 to 600 is difficult and then 600 to 700 is even difficult.
Speaker: agent

8:32
From 700 to 800 is going to be even difficult.
Speaker: agent

8:34
So it is going to be exponential, not linear in terms of the efforts that you have to put.
Speaker: agent

8:39
So that being said, you are going to get to what what their starting point was in maybe around a month, months time, 100 point improvement.
Speaker: agent

8:48
You can you are going to see in 30 to 40 days depending upon the number of hours you put in and then you are going to start from there.
Speaker: agent

8:54
So maybe you take a couple of months more, but that is what you would have to do.
Speaker: agent

8:59
So yeah, once you take your score, let me know I will create it.
Speaker: agent

9:01
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Speaker: prospect

10:36
Hi.
Speaker: prospect

12:48
Where have you taken the mock from this nba.com is it?
Speaker: agent

12:52
Yeah, mba.com now, OK, after that.
Speaker: prospect

13:05
Actually I after that giving that ma.com I just started, you know, with the basic preparation of, you know, just the formulas and how this works and all.
Speaker: prospect

13:15
So after that, I don't want to consume the second test.
Speaker: prospect

13:19
So that's why I gave the Yeah, you shouldn't you shouldn't see the results of mock is actually limited.
Speaker: agent

13:25
You cannot you know wasted its bit scarce to be precise to get the real you know adaptive mocks kind of thing it's actually going to be a bit difficult yeah, GMAT is GMAT is not loading.
Speaker: agent

13:49
So not sure why it is that's OK in your case, like the way I said, I could have just created even the same study plan you are going to create once you, you know, purchase, you know, once you take up the course, you are going to have this see, like can you just see my screen?
Speaker: agent

14:06
Yeah, I can see your screen.
Speaker: prospect

14:09
So you are going to have this getting started videos, the plan where you are going to actually understand how to create this study plan.
Speaker: agent

14:15
So in your case, I am pretty sure since you had this problem, that is why I thought I will help you with that or else I can just do you remember the scores at least on verbal content?
Speaker: agent

14:24
DI I will can I tell you about this test that I gave on Maghush in that actually yeah, you can, you can let me know.
Speaker: prospect

14:33
OK, So what is the score there?
Speaker: agent

14:36
The score was 505 and for the quantitative it is 78.
Speaker: prospect

14:44
So let's let's keep your target.
Speaker: agent

14:46
So we will we will take that score right now.
Speaker: agent

14:48
So maybe later on you can create a plan later on with the existing or you know, once once you get in.
Speaker: agent

14:56
So you can do that.
Speaker: agent

14:57
So it's 99 percentile, which is your target.
Speaker: agent

14:59
And yeah, score is 5, not 50505, correct, Correct.
Speaker: agent

15:04
OK.
Speaker: agent

15:04
And it was, I'm just keeping it as india.com mock and verbal was how much Verbal was 7676, Quant, Swiss quant was 78, 78 and data insights it was 7171.
Speaker: agent

15:28
Meanwhile, before that, could you just share me the your share screen and just show it to me quickly?
Speaker: agent

15:35
Is that possible?
Speaker: agent

15:36
Yeah, sure, sure.
Speaker: prospect

15:42
My screen is visible.
Speaker: prospect

15:45
Yes, yes, it is visible.
Speaker: agent

15:46
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

15:48
So lets take the most recent one, September one, yeah.
Speaker: agent

15:54
So just see the results.
Speaker: agent

15:56
Yeah, can just click see result detail.
Speaker: agent

15:59
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Speaker: prospect

16:10
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

16:11
So lets take quant, lets quickly go down.
Speaker: agent

16:15
Lets lets see.
Speaker: agent

16:23
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

16:24
OK.
Speaker: agent

16:24
Still can you get it a bit lower, just question wise, is there this one?
Speaker: agent

16:32
OK, so hard question you got wrong with AC OK, OK, just one second, a bit slow.
Speaker: agent

16:43
Just wanted to see.
Speaker: agent

16:44
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

16:59
See one of the troubles with this and the inconsistency in the markers because just tell you a scenario.
Speaker: agent

17:06
Yeah, we started with a hard question.
Speaker: agent

17:09
As soon as the first question was wrong, directly switched to EC, not medium and then medium, EC, medium, the second and 3rd was fine and you got right and then went to hard and then again hard got wrong.
Speaker: agent

17:21
Medium, that is fine.
Speaker: agent

17:22
Medium got right and you got to hard.
Speaker: agent

17:25
Hard got wrong again, you got hard.
Speaker: agent

17:27
That is OK, inconsistent with the above pattern but still it is fine.
Speaker: agent

17:31
Then hard got right.
Speaker: agent

17:32
Then you saw medium.
Speaker: agent

17:34
OK, so, so it is not that you know so, so we will see.
Speaker: agent

17:39
The medium also got right.
Speaker: agent

17:40
Then you got again hard, hard got wrong, medium hard and medium got wrong again.
Speaker: agent

17:45
You got hard question and hard question.
Speaker: agent

17:48
That hard question you got right.
Speaker: agent

17:49
Then the medium question.
Speaker: agent

17:50
So what I wanted to show you was it is a mixed bag of questions with for the sake of it, it is adaptive, but it is not the actual adaptive and the focus edition you are going to get a mixed bag of questions.
Speaker: agent

18:02
The first couple of questions would be, you know, would would determine next set of questions and then the next set of questions.
Speaker: agent

18:08
So that's how it's going to be.
Speaker: agent

18:09
So yeah, so a bit differentiating isn't it?
Speaker: agent

18:15
So where you see there are some inconsistency, that's why the score may be a deviation, but still it's fine.
Speaker: agent

18:22
Anyways, if solved there will not be much difference.
Speaker: agent

18:25
But still just wanted to show you know how generally I see this with the mocks.
Speaker: agent

18:31
That's why I just wanted to see if that's the case here also.
Speaker: agent

18:35
So, so here in the hard questions you got right in the 11th question, once you get right again, the next question was medium.
Speaker: agent

18:43
Yeah, so yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

18:48
Alright, so that's OK, we will get back.
Speaker: agent

18:54
So I will, I will just share my screen.
Speaker: agent

18:58
Sure yeah.
Speaker: prospect

19:02
Even the experts global mock you know it is all they will give you 1012 mocks but not adaptive at all.
Speaker: agent

19:08
So it should be a bit mindful of the mocks and purchase it should see the major trouble with the mocks.
Speaker: agent

19:16
If it is not right is because you would eventually build a plan or a strategy assuming that is a scenario which is not and then you create a plan or you know a strategy for it and which would be a counterproductive.
Speaker: agent

19:29
Generally students would say that I got an mocks this is score and when I went there I got this score.
Speaker: agent

19:34
One of the reasons there are couple of reasons.
Speaker: agent

19:36
The first thing is your average accuracy across each other subscriptions might not be determined.
Speaker: agent

19:41
So you would not have known.
Speaker: agent

19:42
Suppose if you take critical reasoning, in critical reasoning you have 9 types of questions assumption, evaluate, strengthen.
Speaker: agent

19:48
We can bold face, miscellaneous we will have like fill in the blanks which is logically completes flop paradox.
Speaker: agent

19:54
So you will have around 9 types of questions and these are the only time type of questions that can come.
Speaker: agent

19:58
So you have to particularly identify and ensure that you are getting.
Speaker: agent

20:01
To get a 90th percentile you have to have a, you know 90th percentile in 95th percentile in verbal.
Speaker: agent

20:08
So in your case in verbal is 97th percentile that we need to chase.
Speaker: agent

20:11
So when we hit target this 97 percentile you have to hit around 92 to 93 percentile in CRN itself.
Speaker: agent

20:17
And similarly for RC to get A902903 percentile in CR you have to have an 80% hard accuracy.
Speaker: agent

20:23
Hard accuracy is every 10 questions you hard questions you solve you have to get 8 questions right.
Speaker: agent

20:27
To get that accuracy you have to understand for each type of question the 9 type of question within CR what is your accuracy in independently each type of question.
Speaker: agent

20:35
Most of them should not be aware of it.
Speaker: agent

20:36
What they do is they would solve then they there is a possibility that you know, say out of 95 topics they are meeting those target percentages remaining.
Speaker: agent

20:44
They are not meeting the test said hypothetically, if question pool increases or the question pool is more proportionately higher from the area of their non high areas where you they are just at 60%, 60 percentage accuracy.
Speaker: agent

20:59
If the question pool is more from there, there eventually the their accuracy is going to dip and of course, consequently their percentiles and consequently their verbal scores.
Speaker: agent

21:08
So that's why you would see a deviation in the scores in the marks that they take or in the in actual test wherever this deviation comes to course or this inconsistency which we need to address.
Speaker: agent

21:17
And most of the students when we encounter them, they would clearly tell them that they are not even aware that OK, in this 9th section what they are accuracy, they are not thought about it.
Speaker: agent

21:25
So that's one of the aspects which creates a differentiator.
Speaker: agent

21:29
The next thing is with the mock, maybe the mock would not be adaptive and they would build a strategy and then we go to the test and then realise that, OK, you know, whatever I have prepared for this not working because that's not the scenario which you wear it.
Speaker: agent

21:42
So our mocks is pretty accurate.
Speaker: agent

21:44
It's plus or -10 so to the to the action test.
Speaker: agent

21:47
So we have done a lot of R&D with that.
Speaker: agent

21:50
So, yeah, so you should make sure I am not telling that it is just us who has cracked it, but you know you just have to go to the scores and see if it makes sense.
Speaker: agent

22:01
In this case, you saw it.
Speaker: agent

22:02
When you get 2 hard or hard questions, right next will not go to medium.
Speaker: agent

22:08
It will be continuing with the hard set of questions.
Speaker: agent

22:10
At least if 3 questions are there in that majority is taken into account.
Speaker: agent

22:14
In that case it is different.
Speaker: agent

22:15
But yeah, so that sometimes does not make sense and that would be a clear indication for you that you do not make have to make.
Speaker: agent

22:22
Maybe you could take the test for solving questions, but not, you know, strategising with that.
Speaker: agent

22:27
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

22:29
All right.
Speaker: agent

22:30
Yeah, my net is a bit slow today.
Speaker: agent

22:32
OK.
Speaker: agent

22:33
So what's your CR&RC percentile in that?
Speaker: agent

22:36
Any idea in verbal?
Speaker: agent

22:40
In verbal, just just a second.
Speaker: agent

22:45
So for it's not showing in that assumption, but mostly I am I am corrected with the.
Speaker: agent

22:57
So I am just putting the capping, just putting the capping for it.
Speaker: agent

23:02
So getting bubble milestone and similarly I will create for corn just to have a fair idea and estimate into.
Speaker: agent

23:11
And to be honest we are going to consider that you take more time because we are going to take that 425 to face value.
Speaker: agent

23:19
We are going to take that.
Speaker: agent

23:20
So it is loading a bit.
Speaker: agent

23:22
Yeah, so edit, load and similarly.
Speaker: agent

23:54
You know, verbal part, I've seen that critical reasoning part was like something that I have most of the time that both of the mocks that I've attempted, they were like, I have most of them I got correct.
Speaker: prospect

24:06
But with when you're talking about RC, it is super bad, like not at all.
Speaker: prospect

24:11
Single.
Speaker: prospect

24:11
Yeah, that's what, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

24:13
So we have to cover from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

24:15
That's what the course would do.
Speaker: agent

24:17
So arithmetic, I'm just taking 60 and 40.
Speaker: agent

24:20
Arithmetic being higher.
Speaker: agent

24:22
Is that the case generally?
Speaker: agent

24:24
Yeah, Yeah, that is true.
Speaker: prospect

24:28
OK and lets also take data insights.
Speaker: agent

24:41
Once your network is fine, it's gonna navigate like butter.
Speaker: agent

24:45
But yeah.
Speaker: agent

24:45
So in my case I guess it's a bit so that's why I am off Cam.
Speaker: agent

24:50
So the previous call it was a bit stuck.
Speaker: agent

24:53
So that's why I went off Cam for OK, better clarity.
Speaker: agent

24:59
So within DS data insights and just taking some random scores just for the sake of it.
Speaker: agent

25:08
And yeah, So what is going to happen is based on the scores that you have, you have you do to get a clear idea in terms of how many hours that you have to study and you know, how many hours you have to put for your verbal quant and DA prep as a whole.
Speaker: agent

25:22
In your case, what should be the average for you think on a working day?
Speaker: agent

25:26
And we, they, we can, you know, what do you think could be your time availability in terms of your breath?
Speaker: agent

25:35
What do you think?
Speaker: prospect

25:36
2 hours?
Speaker: prospect

25:37
I think it's definitely 2.5 hours.
Speaker: prospect

25:39
I can definitely give because my timing will be like 9 to 7.
Speaker: prospect

25:44
So after that, OK, 2 hours after skipping, let's, let's forget about the 52.5, let's skip 2 to be on safer side.
Speaker: agent

25:50
What about weekends?
Speaker: agent

25:52
Weekends I am totally free.
Speaker: prospect

25:53
So we can arrange it as per whatever time which is fine.
Speaker: prospect

25:58
So 5 years or 6 hours.
Speaker: agent

25:59
What do you think on an average 5 years we will keep just be on safe aside again.
Speaker: agent

26:04
And let us assume you start from say tomorrow and let us take a tentative GMAT test it.
Speaker: agent

26:09
It will be 11th of May that you should be ready with if provided this is the score.
Speaker: agent

26:13
But in your case of course a 20 days extra might might you might take because if you take 425 it would have been a bit different.
Speaker: agent

26:20
You would have gone you know maybe towards the starting of June you should be ready.
Speaker: agent

26:26
So, so around 5 to 6 months is what I also estimated.
Speaker: agent

26:30
So because that is what I have seen with students the, the achieving arts for it.
Speaker: agent

26:34
So that is what I also estimated that you would be doing that in terms of number of hours you have to give for your Rep, I will just, you are going to have a calendar view where you are going to have their understanding of what exactly has to be done.
Speaker: agent

26:47
You would have a dedicated mentor in this program.
Speaker: agent

26:49
So I have sent you one video.
Speaker: agent

26:51
Could you?
Speaker: agent

26:52
So can you just go, maybe you can go on a mute.
Speaker: agent

26:55
It is very important that's why I recommended that I have shared it you in WhatsApp video of of the mentor support.
Speaker: agent

27:03
So just watch it and lets come back maybe after 10 its its a 7 minute video should be taking you more time.
Speaker: agent

27:09
Can you just watch it and join back?
Speaker: agent

27:11
I will be in this call.
Speaker: agent

27:12
Only you can let me know once you watch it.
Speaker: agent

27:15
Sure.
Speaker: prospect

27:15
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

27:15
Please.
Speaker: prospect

27:15
Please send.
Speaker: prospect

27:16
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

33:48
Yeah, I went through the video.
Speaker: prospect

33:52
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

33:52
So that's that's regarding the mentor support that you're going to get along with the program.
Speaker: agent

33:57
So it's not something which you're going to be charged.
Speaker: agent

34:00
That's something which you're going to have by default along with the course.
Speaker: agent

34:03
So that's how you saw how the, you know, resolution if you have any topics doubt or something where you want your, you know, subject expert to create a video for you and all these things.
Speaker: agent

34:13
So all these options are there in terms of your preparation within the portal itself, you are going to have this learning modules like the way it is, it was reflecting there within verbal.
Speaker: agent

34:21
If you see in your case, you are going to start with master comprehension, you know, do you know what creates the difference between what reading competition versus struggle, right.
Speaker: agent

34:30
So generally asking, do you know what is the difference between a hard passage and an easy passage?
Speaker: agent

34:35
What do you think would be the major difference somewhere down the line?
Speaker: agent

34:39
I feel like understanding the passage deep down so that the questions will be placed as per that because what I have seen it is not direct question.
Speaker: prospect

34:48
As soon as you move towards the hearts passage, you really have to understand that passage deeply understand and then you will be able to answer that particular question.
Speaker: prospect

34:57
So that is I have observed so far.
Speaker: prospect

35:00
OK so that is one of the byproduct to be precise.
Speaker: agent

35:04
So the major key factor which makes a passage and excel this for everyone.
Speaker: agent

35:09
I will see in your case you have let talking about your perspective but in general perspective what we see is what makes the passage difficult and easy is the structuring of sentences.
Speaker: agent

35:18
For every hard passage you would see that the passage would be comprising of a lot of long sentences like 25 to 30 words.
Speaker: agent

35:25
And So what happens is see all all this long sentences are also found using a chain of thoughts by an author.
Speaker: agent

35:34
So this chain of thoughts are formed the forms into short sentences which is interlinked to form a long sentence.
Speaker: agent

35:43
So this long sentences are responsible for you to have or or spend a lot of your time rereading things.
Speaker: agent

35:51
You would eventually eat up a lot of time which subsequently going to affect your remaining performance in your section because one section if you are if you are sitting and doing or particular set of questions, you know generally you would have seen that you are solving it.
Speaker: agent

36:04
You are taking 6 to 7 minutes to solve the first question, then again the remaining questions you are going to come back to that particular passage once again to answer those questions and that is again taking you a couple of minutes.
Speaker: agent

36:13
So technically in CR also you will eat up a lot of time for your CR as Welland then you eventually come down from that hard category to medium category to is category.
Speaker: agent

36:22
That is how it it moves and that is something which is responsible for your low score.
Speaker: agent

36:26
So we have to cover from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

36:29
So someone who is already at a 70th percentile or 80th percentile will recommend them to skip this because they would also already be thorough with it.
Speaker: agent

36:36
They are reading competition.
Speaker: agent

36:37
It is on point and at 8080 percentage accuracy, we generally recommend them not to take it.
Speaker: agent

36:43
In your case, you have to take it because you are going to have some learnings from here in terms of how to make your reading more effective.
Speaker: agent

36:48
So we are going to learn how this long and complicated sentences have formed in the first place.
Speaker: agent

36:52
And once you learn the art of how this long sentences are formed, then you are going to learn how to deconstruct it as single read.
Speaker: agent

36:58
And then we will have this pause points which is there which is actually going to help you understand where the pause strategically for efficient note taking and in the least possible words, how to identify what is important and what is not in a passage.
Speaker: agent

37:10
And then take notes and how to use these notes to solve your 3 or 4 questions that follows a passage and not the not the passage in itself.
Speaker: agent

37:18
So these are the strategies which the people who are at the top, you know, scorers of 90th percentile, 95th percentile plus and global do.
Speaker: agent

37:27
So what you are going to do is replicate that because the technique is very you know, efficiently a proven especially the verbal section and all has been there since ages.
Speaker: agent

37:36
So the the standard technique to improve in your reading competition is already there.
Speaker: agent

37:41
What we need to do is understand how to do it and learn technique to how to how to execute it.
Speaker: agent

37:46
And then you are also going to have some skill building exercises where you are going to learn, you know, inferring meaning, then quantifiers, comparisons, then all all this understanding references all this in 7 and cover.
Speaker: agent

38:00
So this is actually going to take you around 7 and a half hours of your time.
Speaker: agent

38:04
So this would in your case would take 3 to 4 working days or maybe a you know, one and a half days in a weekend is going to going to take for master compensation.
Speaker:

38:14
Once master compensation is done, then you go for critical racing.
Speaker: agent

38:17
So within critical racing again we start with the foundational concept.
Speaker: agent

38:21
Every CR question has a structure right?
Speaker: agent

38:22
One paragraph followed by a question, same followed by 5 options.
Speaker: agent

38:25
That is a standard structure that is ever going to come in your CR.
Speaker: agent

38:28
There is no other structure for CR apart from this.
Speaker: agent

38:31
So what are what are those paragraph comprising of?
Speaker: agent

38:33
Every CR question comprise of the same phenomenon, premise and conclusion.
Speaker: agent

38:37
So that is what the paragraph is made of.
Speaker: agent

38:38
Every every CR question we are going to learn more about that.
Speaker: agent

38:42
So we have 4 files learning models for that and each would be followed up with this, you know quizzes towards the end to assess how much you have learned from it.
Speaker: agent

38:50
And also you are going to have a journey view.
Speaker: agent

38:52
Within journey view you are going to see yourself getting compared.
Speaker: agent

38:55
Now you you compare your performance with the median global population in terms of their first starting scores or first starting scores for each of the file.
Speaker: agent

39:02
If you are getting grade A, that's indicator that you are doing really Welland if you are getting grade with that means that you are doing at par, you need improvement.
Speaker: agent

39:08
So you are going to have some pop ups in terms and reviews that you are going to do.
Speaker: agent

39:12
And if you are getting rate C, that means that you have to redo the complete file once more.
Speaker: agent

39:16
If this file you are getting a grade C, you are going to redo this complete file once more.
Speaker: agent

39:21
So that is that is the indicator.
Speaker: agent

39:23
And there is also another significance of this grading.
Speaker: agent

39:25
If you are consistently getting an overall, if you see the learning also starts from level zero to Level 3.
Speaker: agent

39:30
So what happens is we are like, you know, I assume that you would have played games, you know earlier.
Speaker: agent

39:36
So you would see that the boss fight always comes to the end, right?
Speaker: agent

39:38
So you that happens because initially when you start, you have to understand the mechanics.
Speaker: agent

39:44
You have to understand the basic things and then upgrade yourself in terms of your here, in terms of your understanding there, in terms of your tools or techniques or unlocking powers.
Speaker: agent

39:54
So here what happens is you want to unlock those techniques, unlock the, you know, those learnings from yourself at each level, which is.
Speaker: agent

40:01
So initially if you are getting say grade C here and grade C here, it will be very surprising to get a grade A here because your quality of learning was poised.
Speaker: agent

40:11
So your focus is.
Speaker: agent

40:13
It will be very easy for you to get a grade A here and if you get a grade A here, A here, you are going to have an easy task in getting a grade A here and then it is going to be an easy task to get grade A here and then it will be going to easy task to get a grade A here.
Speaker: agent

40:26
So it is going to be progressive.
Speaker: agent

40:27
So you cannot.
Speaker: agent

40:28
So the another significance is initially when you start your prep say suppose you are at 33rd percentile, you have to go to 94th percentile.
Speaker: agent

40:35
It does not happen overnight, right?
Speaker: agent

40:37
It does not happen that you studied for 6 months and the 6 month and day one after that you are going to magically switch to 94.
Speaker: agent

40:44
Your progress is going to be very you know it is going to happen throughout your journey, right?
Speaker: agent

40:50
So you are going to see that your progress you are progressing from that 33rd to 50th percentile, then 70th percentile, then 84th percentile, then 94th percentile.
Speaker: agent

40:59
So you will have a lot of milestones where you would be you know crossing those and then you would have that feedback also.
Speaker: agent

41:05
What if you spend the whole duration then you realise that it has does not help.
Speaker: agent

41:10
It is not the time commitment that you are giving, you are also giving your, you know it is not about the money, it is also about the time commitment that you are giving here.
Speaker: agent

41:17
So which cannot be taken back and you have to apply for round one.
Speaker: agent

41:21
So once you realise it by June it will be too late.
Speaker: agent

41:24
You cannot do anything at that point of time.
Speaker: agent

41:26
So we do not want that to happen.
Speaker: agent

41:27
You have to have a clear indication of when you are improving and if you are not improving there is a reason.
Speaker: agent

41:32
So that is why you have a mentor to understand how it works and they they are going to keep track of it and going to give you constant feedbacks in terms of your prep.
Speaker: agent

41:40
So, so it will be a task basic approach.
Speaker: agent

41:42
So if you are purchasing the course today, you would get a mentor assigned by tomorrow.
Speaker: agent

41:45
And So what what would happen is they are going to give you the first set of task to do.
Speaker: agent

41:50
You are going to finish it there, then they are going to evaluate it, they are going to give you feedbacks and then you are going to go to the next task.
Speaker: agent

41:54
So it will be task based approach that you are going to proceed.
Speaker: agent

41:58
And of course it is it is guided by your, this is a framework.
Speaker: agent

42:01
If you are aware of the concept of framework in a, you know IT, we have this framework, right.
Speaker: agent

42:05
So this is a framework, but we build your plan on top of that, on top of the framework to if you related to your needs.
Speaker: agent

42:12
So that is that is how it is going to be.
Speaker: agent

42:14
And like the way I said, once we cover this, you know, foundation concepts and each other files.
Speaker: agent

42:22
If you look at each other module, one of the each module is a different type of question.
Speaker: agent

42:26
The first part initially you would start with concept files.
Speaker: agent

42:28
So you learn the concepts and the techniques, the DIP centric and all these things would be covered here.
Speaker: agent

42:33
And then we go for the application files where whatever you have learned is not natural to you.
Speaker: agent

42:37
You have to make it a muscle memory.
Speaker: agent

42:39
You have to make sure that that comes as a default technique for you.
Speaker: agent

42:42
So that we have application files where the objective is only to get the right answer with your given technique in respect of the time that you take.
Speaker: agent

42:48
Then inference practice file with the time space you have to get the right answer is in the given technique.
Speaker: agent

42:53
Similarly, each type of question, once you cover each type of questions, you would be navigating through your complete levels like level zero, level one.
Speaker: agent

43:00
So the course in itself is designed to have tougher topics towards the end of the learning modules.
Speaker: agent

43:05
So yeah, you will, you will cover Level 3 and then what you do is you are going to go to stage 2.
Speaker: agent

43:10
Your stage one is done when you go to stage 2.
Speaker: agent

43:12
So within stage 2, let me I think I have already opened it.
Speaker: agent

43:16
In stage 2, you are going to take subsection marks.
Speaker: agent

43:18
You have completed CR, but when you complete CR, you are 33rd percentile based on your quality of learning, you would be in a spectrum.
Speaker: agent

43:26
So here in this case, you are consistently at a grade A throughout.
Speaker: agent

43:29
So you would be in a spectrum between 45 percentile to 45th percentile to a 70th percentile.
Speaker: agent

43:36
That will be the spectrum in stage one.
Speaker: agent

43:38
So you are currently at 33 from 33.
Speaker: agent

43:40
Maybe if your quality of learning is really poor in that case, like you have BCBB kind of grade or BBCC kind of grade.
Speaker: agent

43:48
In that case.
Speaker: agent

43:49
In that scenario, you would be at the lower end of the spectrum, like you would be at a 45th, 15th percentile.
Speaker: agent

43:53
But if your quality of learning is good and you are at grade A, So what you would be at a 70th percentile.
Speaker: agent

43:58
So even if you are at 70th percentile you are not at 20:00, 4th percentile age.
Speaker: agent

44:02
So to get a 94th percentile you have to have an accuracy of hard accuracy of 80 percentage that should be a threshold.
Speaker: agent

44:07
In this case the threshold is kept as just one second.
Speaker: agent

44:11
In this case the threshold is kept as 70 percentage for this student which have copy pasted.
Speaker: agent

44:16
So in your case will be 80 percentage.
Speaker: agent

44:19
Initially you would be below that is OK.
Speaker: agent

44:21
You are going to have a clear idea.
Speaker: agent

44:22
So this part you have already seen in the video like with NCR within top level, you are going to see what is your accuracy, what is your average correct time, incorrect time based on which you will be doing the course correction and wherever it is required.
Speaker: agent

44:34
If your mentor is asking you to go back to the course because we capture a lot of data here, we are going to clearly pinpoint what exactly are the cost of inference is your cause of trouble, what is the complete stage one, your mentor is exactly going to tell you the files which maybe you have faltered, maybe you can do better.
Speaker: agent

44:49
They would ask you to take those files where you are going to take it and make sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.
Speaker: agent

44:54
Then actually you can come back and create custom quizzes.
Speaker: agent

44:57
Within custom quizzes you can actually you know just select those particular files and ensure that you are going to make sure that you are going to practice those questions.
Speaker: agent

45:06
If it is inferential or you have went back, you made sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.
Speaker: agent

45:10
Now it is your focus on inference to make it cross 80 percentage accuracy.
Speaker: agent

45:15
So you are going to take inference in custom quizzes and ensure that it is crossing.
Speaker: agent

45:18
So independently if 3 or 4 weaknesses, they are going to identify independently and make sure that those weakness are dealt with.
Speaker: agent

45:25
So when you when you isolate your weakness and improve on your weakness, initially your score was being pulled down because of that weakness.
Speaker: agent

45:31
Once that weakness in itself is about saved your 80 percentage threshold which is which would be yours.
Speaker: agent

45:36
You want to say that now you are going above the threshold and that is an indicator that you are ready for the next game.
Speaker: agent

45:41
So you are in a different next session.
Speaker: agent

45:43
The same happens for reading competition and other sections in quantity as well.
Speaker: agent

45:46
In quants we have something better like we have something called pace.
Speaker: agent

45:52
So even when you start from quans, quans is an area which is highly concept like.
Speaker: agent

45:58
It is high on concepts like unlike verbal and data insights, you would have very minimal concepts to learn.
Speaker: agent

46:04
But in in quans is an area which have lot of concepts and eventually it is going to take really lot of time to complete the conception.
Speaker: agent

46:11
So we understand that even when you start maybe you are not that strong but it is not that you do not know anything at all.
Speaker: agent

46:19
Maybe in the worst case you still know 20% of it 80% you don't know we can accept that.
Speaker: agent

46:24
So.
Speaker: agent

46:25
So what we need is at least for the 20% that you have or in some cases you would already know 60 percentage, just 40 percentage you have to learn.
Speaker: agent

46:33
So we don't want you to waste your time in things which you already know.
Speaker: agent

46:36
So for that we have something called PACE which is personalised adaptive course engine.
Speaker: agent

46:40
So what it does is it actually evaluates by you know you are you are understanding you by now you know that each of the modulus type of question.
Speaker: agent

46:47
So you for for those type of questions you are going to have a diagnostic quiz.
Speaker: agent

46:53
Within that there will be multiple concepts and all the things which will be covered based on how you perform in the quiz.
Speaker: agent

46:58
Your average correct time, incorrect time, other pressure, you know the other other pressure graph plots and all this things that we capture and also your activity.
Speaker: agent

47:06
You are going to recommend only those particular topics where you need to spend your time and going to recommend you to skip the topics which you are already thorough with.
Speaker: agent

47:14
Here you see 90 to 2 percentage and only 2 files like exponents.
Speaker: agent

47:18
You are recommended other areas you can skip by.
Speaker: agent

47:20
So this would give you a guarantee that you don't.
Speaker: agent

47:22
You don't have to have the fear of missing out.
Speaker: agent

47:24
Sometimes what happens is see we know that we know it.
Speaker: agent

47:27
Suppose if you look at say number classification, we know we are aware of number classification but what would eventually happen is we fear of skipping it because we will think OK what if I miss out on something critical.
Speaker: agent

47:38
So you don't have to have that guilt here.
Speaker: agent

47:40
You are not missing out on anything critical or anything important that would you know, help you improve your score.
Speaker: agent

47:46
You are not missing out on anything.
Speaker: agent

47:47
That is why it is really accurate as well.
Speaker: agent

47:50
Here you saw 100 percentage and nothing was recommended to skip again.
Speaker: agent

47:53
But in fractions you saw 100 percentage.
Speaker: agent

47:54
And then still it is recommending you to take 2 photo of the files because even though you got 100 percentage, maybe your technique of solving in terms of the time taken or other other aspects, maybe these are the 2 files where you can improve your technique after you watch.
Speaker: agent

48:08
So wherever we have the slightest of the doubt that this area may not be as strong hold for you, you are going to recommend you to take it.
Speaker: agent

48:14
So eventually you are going to save time for the topics which are already through it and wanna you know.
Speaker: agent

48:20
So here even though got 100% 4 files are recommended.
Speaker: agent

48:24
So there there are only 2 files are recommended.
Speaker: agent

48:26
So here 4 files are recommended depends on the scenario.
Speaker: agent

48:28
Here also again 100 percentage and here again 100 percentage 2 files are recommended.
Speaker: agent

48:33
So depending upon that scenario based thing, if you look at say if I take number properties within number properties, yeah, you got 170 percentage, some of the files recommended, some of the files are skipped.
Speaker: agent

48:49
You can see that here, right?
Speaker: agent

48:50
So in in this case all the files were recommended for you to take because you have to learn from here.
Speaker: agent

48:55
There is something you cannot skip anything at all.
Speaker: agent

48:58
And then divisible to reminders again, everything was recommended.
Speaker: agent

49:01
You have to take everything and wherever you are strong at here, based on which you got some recommended to skip some you have to take.
Speaker: agent

49:07
So this is actually, so this is like a fingerprint.
Speaker: agent

49:11
Your case may not be the same like you have a twin brother with the same capability with the same score and same sectionals also.
Speaker: agent

49:18
Then also when you come here, maybe this pattern to this deep, it will be different for each of you in terms of the number of hours that you put in a number of studies.
Speaker: agent

49:27
So that is how it makes a highly customizable and highly personalised study approach.
Speaker: agent

49:33
And you cannot, you can never expect this in a life class or in terms of a bats kind of class.
Speaker: agent

49:39
It's not gonna happen because nobody is gonna give you that data or have have this focus.
Speaker: agent

49:43
So that's something which you're gonna have with this program.
Speaker: agent

49:47
So yeah.
Speaker: agent

49:48
OK, now let's let's address your doubts as well.
Speaker: agent

49:51
So if you have something, you can discuss that also.
Speaker: agent

49:54
Yep.
Speaker: agent

49:55
So I think I'm pretty clear about this, how this dashboard is going to work and how this course curriculum is going to work that as I'm pretty sure of.
Speaker: prospect

50:04
So yeah, Yep.
Speaker: prospect

50:06
And I would is there is there any possible can I go some through demo classes or something like that?
Speaker: prospect

50:12
Is it available on Gmail?
Speaker: prospect

50:14
See, we have free trial.
Speaker: agent

50:16
Have you seen the free trial?
Speaker: agent

50:18
No, I have not gone through it.
Speaker: prospect

50:20
So you can just share your screen right now and I will help you.
Speaker: agent

50:25
I'll direct it to you.
Speaker: agent

50:26
So the free trial, the, you know, approach is I'm I'm aware of that, like how on the GMAT on the e GMAT platform, how that we're going to access that free trial.
Speaker: prospect

50:35
I'm aware of I'm not applying right now because I have I have to be out of India for like one week ahead.
Speaker: prospect

50:42
So that's why I'm not using our free trial is unlimited.
Speaker: agent

50:45
You don't have to subscribe to it or you don't have to give your card.
Speaker: agent

50:48
So it's for infinite period of time.
Speaker: agent

50:50
So the free trial that is seen in our platform, yes.
Speaker: agent

50:54
So if you can take, I will just show you, if not, I will just tell you verbally.
Speaker: agent

50:58
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

50:58
So what what you are going to have is not a systematic learning there.
Speaker: agent

51:02
You cannot expect from the fundamentals like the way we discussed right learning level 0123, maybe here you are going to directly fight the middle boss.
Speaker: agent

51:10
So you should not be decided by the difficulty of the topic but rather focus on how they teach.
Speaker: agent

51:16
Are you comfortable with that teaching approach?
Speaker: agent

51:19
So that is what your whole idea should be, not to worry about if I am doing well in it or not.
Speaker: agent

51:24
You don't have to bother about it at this point of time.
Speaker: agent

51:27
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

51:28
So that's what happened for about randomly taken the teaching pattern.
Speaker: prospect

51:32
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

51:34
So we have a randomly taken sample from verbal quantum DI just for you to understand how we teach.
Speaker: agent

51:41
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: agent

51:44
So if you can just take I will help you with it so that you would get a clear idea of how to take the free trial.
Speaker: agent

51:49
And in terms of within verbal within points.
Speaker: agent

51:52
I will tell you about the diagnostic quiz.
Speaker: agent

51:55
One of the students actually took the diagnostic question just thinking don't we have a lesson?
Speaker: agent

51:59
It is just a test because the first 2 are diagnostic quiz which the students saw.
Speaker: agent

52:03
OK, so can you just log into it?
Speaker: agent

52:08
Can you just sign in with your same Google Google?
Speaker: agent

53:01
Maybe you can plug in your device maybe because of the power?
Speaker: agent

53:04
Ohh sorry I didn't get it.
Speaker: prospect

53:12
Maybe you can plug in your device, maybe because of the low power the bandwidth.
Speaker: agent

53:57
You can close it for the time being.
Speaker: agent

54:03
You just select with select.
Speaker: agent

54:04
You know just just select verbal or something quanter bubble or something just click it.
Speaker: agent

54:14
So here in critical reasoning you don't have to open it.
Speaker: agent

54:18
I am just I will help you navigate to it.
Speaker: agent

54:21
Maybe you can press Start learning.
Speaker: agent

54:22
Just click on Start learning there.
Speaker: agent

54:27
So on this one, so in introduction itself, we just Scroll down in that right page.
Speaker: agent

54:34
Just Scroll down.
Speaker: agent

54:35
You're gonna have videos, you know, here.
Speaker: agent

54:38
So yeah, got it.
Speaker: prospect

54:44
So so these are the scroll so so so you can see it will be in different ways in different space.
Speaker: agent

54:51
It will be so maybe for this you are going to have, you know, a page like this or else it will be a different set of page that you navigate through.
Speaker: agent

54:59
So depending upon the course, by course you are going to have a different structure.
Speaker: agent

55:03
So all, all, all we have is video lessons which should navigate through and try to understand.
Speaker: agent

55:08
Are you able to grasp what is being communicated?
Speaker: agent

55:10
It is the language very clear to you is, is it just, is it communicating, you know, in synchronise with what you expect.
Speaker: agent

55:18
So you can evaluate on those grounds and then take a call.
Speaker: agent

55:22
Even for verbal quantities.
Speaker: agent

55:23
Can you just go back?
Speaker: agent

55:23
I will just quickly show you the quant as well that you know how you would have to take.
Speaker: agent

55:38
So within within no, no, do not go back.
Speaker: agent

55:42
No, you can just go forward.
Speaker: agent

55:48
OK, So within within number properties, you would first see this diagnostic quest which is there, right?
Speaker: agent

55:55
You are going to take it and accordingly it is going to recommend you to skip some areas and going to ask you to take some areas.
Speaker: agent

56:00
But maybe in this scenario you can avoid diagnostic quiz and directly take the concept because of course here we are not planning to.
Speaker: agent

56:07
So this is diagnostic issue you have selected, right?
Speaker: agent

56:09
So we can you not take that you can directly start with concept because of course the point of skipping and all these things are there which you can actually do it in the actual platform.
Speaker: agent

56:19
This is not for saving your time, right?
Speaker: agent

56:21
This is for you to understand.
Speaker: agent

56:23
So you do not have to save your time here.
Speaker: agent

56:25
So you can directly start with concepts and then you can so here you just have to press Start learning the top.
Speaker: agent

56:38
So just go down everywhere you are going to have videos like this where no, no, just just go up, go up.
Speaker: agent

56:45
You have to watch this video, then then go to the next files kind of things.
Speaker: agent

56:49
And then so it will be tutors will be explaining things to you.
Speaker: agent

56:53
So once you finish it, you can go to the next and just go down.
Speaker: agent

56:56
Then you will have one small test here understanding it's not if we are not going to capture any data from here just for you understanding.
Speaker: agent

57:03
Then you go to the next file and towards then you are going to have a test as well.
Speaker: agent

57:06
So after takeaways you are going to go to the next like down you see Section 2, right Section 2 you are going to have for odd numbers you are going to click there.
Speaker: agent

57:15
So next you are going to go to the odd numbers then the next the next.
Speaker: agent

57:18
So you are going to navigate like that here again the video lessons.
Speaker: agent

57:23
So you are going to watch it and then go to the next.
Speaker: agent

57:25
So just check it out and let me know.
Speaker: agent

57:28

Speaker: prospect

58:06
And since you would be travelling, suppose if you are able to take up free, some free talent depending upon even if you purchased say tomorrow or day after tomorrow does not mean that you have to start on the same day.
