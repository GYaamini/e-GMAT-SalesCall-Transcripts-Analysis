0:02
What are you doing with respect to the Gmap preparation?
Speaker: agent

0:04
Have you started it?
Speaker: agent

0:05
Is this your first time?
Speaker: agent

0:06
And what's the plan?
Speaker: agent

0:07
If you can give me a little bit idea.
Speaker: agent

0:10
It's my first time I've I've taken this decision very recently to write Gmap like maybe a one week or two weeks ago.
Speaker: prospect

0:21
So got it.
Speaker: agent

0:23
So I have just gone through few walks, I mean not answered them just the PDF kind of things and just looked at them.
Speaker: prospect

0:34
So just understand the pattern and everything.
Speaker: prospect

0:36
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:37
That's it.
Speaker: prospect

0:38
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:39
So what what is the main goal?
Speaker: agent

0:42
Which B schools do you want to go to and when do you want to start your MBA program?
Speaker: agent

0:47
What's the goal there?
Speaker: agent

0:51
I want to go to ISB.
Speaker: prospect

0:53
OK, ISP.
Speaker: agent

0:56
Got it.
Speaker: agent

0:58
The full time, the two year MBA, the the full time normal PGP program.
Speaker: prospect

1:02
Is that the goal?
Speaker: agent

1:04
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

1:05
PGPYLPGPYL.
Speaker: prospect

1:08
So right now you're in your 4th year or what's the current status?
Speaker: agent

1:14
I've been working.
Speaker: prospect

1:15
It's been 10 months.
Speaker: prospect

1:17
Got it.
Speaker: agent

1:18
Maybe I should get ready in three months and then I should submit my application.
Speaker: prospect

1:25
I think I should get more about ISP procedure and everything.
Speaker: prospect

1:31
Understood.
Speaker: agent

1:32
So you're, you're saying you have the VILE deadline in April?
Speaker: agent

1:34
Is that what it is?
Speaker: agent

1:37
Application deadline?
Speaker: agent

1:38
Yeah, March or April, March or April and below.
Speaker: prospect

1:44
One year, work experience is below.
Speaker: prospect

1:46
2 years of work experience is something they are eligible for.
Speaker: agent

1:48
VILE, right?
Speaker: agent

1:49
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

1:50
Yeah, two years.
Speaker: prospect

1:51
We build less than two years.
Speaker: agent

1:52
More than two years.
Speaker: agent

1:53
It's the the normal PGP program.
Speaker: agent

1:55
OK, got it.
Speaker: agent

1:57
Understood.
Speaker: agent

1:57
So you'll have to wrap up the entire process in about 3 months or so.
Speaker: agent

2:03
Got it.
Speaker: prospect

2:03
I just want to double check this one ISBYL application deadlines.
Speaker: agent

2:11
That way we'll have a proper timeline.
Speaker: agent

2:15
Yeah, March 16th, that's the deadline.
Speaker: agent

2:19
I'm sharing the screen.
Speaker: agent

2:22
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

2:24
Can you see the screen?
Speaker: agent

2:27
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

2:27
At LE Career Professional, zero to 24.
Speaker: agent

2:29
It's a 20 month program, application deadline March 16th, Round 2.
Speaker: agent

2:35
So by March 16th you'll have to take the GMAT, work on the application draft and completely do the submission as well.
Speaker: agent

2:41
That's the last date.
Speaker: agent

2:42
So right now, forget January is over, you have February and made of one.
Speaker: agent

2:48
1 1/2 month is there to do the entire thing currently as of now.
Speaker: agent

2:52
OK fine, got it.
Speaker: prospect

2:54
Understood.
Speaker: agent

2:54
And for this 1 1/2 month on a daily basis, practically speaking, how much time can, you know, take out just for studying for the GMAT and this other stuff?
Speaker: agent

3:06
Four to five hours because I have to go got it.
Speaker: prospect

3:10
Four to five hours.
Speaker: agent

3:11
Four to five hours is a lot of time for studying actually.
Speaker: agent

3:13
So that is good.
Speaker: agent

3:14
If you can take four to five hours, good enough.
Speaker: agent

3:17
One 1 1/2 month timeline every day, four to five hours, I believe Saturday and Sunday you can put in more time that is possible.
Speaker: agent

3:24
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

3:25
Then, then, then time investment is will not be a constraint for you.
Speaker: agent

3:30
You would have good amount.
Speaker: agent

3:32
You don't have the luxury of time because we have to wrap it up in 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

3:35
But 45 hours is actually good amount of time to achieve anything in in about 45 days.
Speaker: agent

3:40
So that that part is good.
Speaker: agent

3:42
It's just that how do we utilize the time?
Speaker: agent

3:44
Are we studying in the right format, right structure that we're following or not?
Speaker: agent

3:48
That's the deal.
Speaker: agent

3:48
That's going to be the deal breaker.
Speaker: agent

3:50
In your case, that would happen.
Speaker: agent

3:52
OK, All right, so this part is there.
Speaker: agent

3:54
Now I want to understand a couple of more things.
Speaker: agent

3:56
Do you have a GMAT score in mind right now, a target GMAT score in mind, 700 plus is what 700 plus is something that is required.
Speaker: agent

4:08
7:05 or higher than that is something which you need.
Speaker: agent

4:13
So how did you get to this target?
Speaker: agent

4:18
How somebody told you or no?
Speaker: agent

4:23
When I'm going through this ISP admission process, they said that it's 700 plus.
Speaker: prospect

4:28
It will be good if you get 700 plus, correct, correct, correct.
Speaker: prospect

4:33
So probably they are talking about the old GMAT 700 plus because that used to be an average score at ISB.
Speaker: agent

4:43
Now we have a new GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:45
The calculation and all is different.
Speaker: agent

4:47
On the old GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:48
A 700 score is equal to a 645 on the new GMAT.
Speaker: agent

4:53
So that that that that hazard that is something which is there.
Speaker: agent

4:56
But regardless of that which for ISB, for YL program, because most early career candidates of play, they do threaten to submit a higher score because they are just fresh out of college.
Speaker: agent

5:09
It's easy for them to prepare for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

5:12
So they do generally submit a higher score.
Speaker: agent

5:14
So in your case, 7:05 or higher is definitely should aim for it 99th percentile.
Speaker: agent

5:21
But even if you get a 670, 5685 score a little bit lower, it's fine.
Speaker: agent

5:26
675 or higher than that 96th percentile or higher than that, that would be a good target for ISP for the while program.
Speaker: agent

5:33
So that part is there.
Speaker: agent

5:35
So yeah, you know, so 705 is your target if you get 20 points lower still OK, that that's what it it's going to be.
Speaker: agent

5:42
And right now you, you, I know you have looked at some old questions and tests, but how do you have full familiarity on the aspects of GMAT?
Speaker: agent

5:55
I mean, especially the questions.
Speaker: agent

5:56
Verbal is there within verbal, there are two types of things.
Speaker: agent

5:59
Critical reasoning, reading comprehension in quant arithmetic, algebra, in data insights, 4 type of questions are there that familiarity exists as of now or no?
Speaker: agent

6:09
Yeah, that exists.
Speaker: prospect

6:11
Critical, critical reasoning is separate or reading comprehension is separate.
Speaker: prospect

6:14
You're, you're familiar with that.
Speaker: prospect

6:17
OK, that is very good, that works.
Speaker: agent

6:20
And so obviously you'll have to start the preparation right away.
Speaker: agent

6:24
Like tomorrow onwards, you'll have to start the preparation.
Speaker: agent

6:27
There is no one day.
Speaker: agent

6:30
Two days is also a huge amount of time in, in your case, because the deadline is in about 1 1/2 month for sure we have to start right away.
Speaker: agent

6:39
So you let me know exactly what do you want from this discussion.
Speaker: agent

6:43
I'll try to focus on in that direction.
Speaker: agent

6:45
What's the main goal?
Speaker: agent

6:46
What do you want from this discussion?
Speaker: agent

6:49
I just need the process to study.
Speaker: prospect

6:51
I mean, how will I get that score?
Speaker: prospect

6:55
I need a process like I couldn't work on them.
Speaker: prospect

6:59
It's not too difficult and too easy, but you got it.
Speaker: prospect

7:05
How exactly to structure the overall preparation, what to follow, what to do, what not to do in a, in, in the in the next one week, what to do next, another one week, what to do that overall clarity unit.
Speaker: agent

7:15
Definitely, we'll discuss all those aspects in a proper structured way.
Speaker: agent

7:18
We'll discuss that.
Speaker: agent

7:20
Couple of more questions with respect to resources for studying for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

7:25
Do you already have a course or are you looking for the EGMAT course to study the next in the next 45 days?
Speaker: agent

7:30
What is the plan there for the resources for the GMAT?
Speaker: agent

7:36
I have some books.
Speaker: prospect

7:38
I got them online.
Speaker: prospect

7:40
I mean, I just ordered them.
Speaker: prospect

7:42
I'll tell you the book means yeah.
Speaker: prospect

8:08
This GMAT official guide that kind of I've got GMAT GMAT official Guide, normal book, right?
Speaker: prospect

8:17
the IT has all the three sections, verbal, quant and data insights.
Speaker: prospect

8:21
Yeah, yeah, got it.
Speaker: agent

8:24
What else is there?
Speaker: agent

8:28
That is the only book you have.
Speaker: agent

8:29
OK, understood, got it.
Speaker: agent

8:31
So definitely you have to spend some time on that book.
Speaker: agent

8:35
That is an official book.
Speaker: agent

8:37
It's the most authentic resource out there that you have to do, but you cannot do it right away.
Speaker: agent

8:44
So the official guide is nothing but a set of previous GMAT questions, the old GMAT questions, it has a bunch of things.
Speaker: agent

8:52
Definitely you have to practice those questions.
Speaker: agent

8:54
That way you would know that you are ready for the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

8:57
If you can solve those questions, obviously you can solve the GMAT kind of questions as well.
Speaker: agent

9:02
That is number one.
Speaker: agent

9:03
And of course there is a problem with that book.
Speaker: agent

9:05
It has more of easy questions.
Speaker: agent

9:06
It doesn't have a lot of hard level questions.
Speaker: agent

9:09
That's how it is.
Speaker: agent

9:10
That's that's what they do.
Speaker: agent

9:11
But yeah, unfortunately, but you have to do that.
Speaker: agent

9:14
But that's not a book to learning learn stuff.
Speaker: agent

9:19
Let's say for example, critical reasoning is there.
Speaker: agent

9:21
There are a bunch of concepts that you need to learn.
Speaker: agent

9:23
You need to learn the right methodology to solve critical reasoning questions.
Speaker: agent

9:27
Similarly, algebra is there, bunch of concepts are there, and you need to have the right methodology to solve very hard level questions.
Speaker: agent

9:33
A step by step method should be learned.
Speaker: agent

9:35
All those things.
Speaker: agent

9:36
You cannot do that from book.
Speaker: agent

9:37
That book is mainly for practice.
Speaker: agent

9:40
So in your specific case, because you're a beginner to the preparation, your sequence of preparation will be like this.
Speaker: agent

9:46
First you have to build a strong foundation \#1 foundations and basics.
Speaker: agent

9:50
For on verbal quant, data insets, you'll have to fix.
Speaker: agent

9:53
Then you have to learn the concepts that are tested on the GMAT.
Speaker: agent

9:57
Then you have to learn the right method.
Speaker: agent

9:59
So you have foundation, you have conceptual and theoretical knowledge.
Speaker: agent

10:03
Now, when you see a critical reasoning question, what is the method to solve it?
Speaker: agent

10:08
When you see a algebra question, what is the method to solve it?
Speaker: agent

10:11
You have to learn those methods and then you have to practice a lot using those methods.
Speaker: agent

10:17
In that practice stage, that book will come in place.
Speaker: agent

10:21
But before that, there are bunch of things that need to happen.
Speaker: agent

10:24
If we do not do these bunch of things, if we directly jump into practice, it will be a disaster.
Speaker: agent

10:29
So I mean that, that that's what it is.
Speaker: agent

10:31
I'm, I'm trying to be very transparent and little bit brutal as well, but that's what it is.
Speaker: agent

10:36
So the book alone is not sufficient for sure.
Speaker: agent

10:39
And because you have to wrap up your Gmap preparation in 1 1/2 month, you have to go for a course.
Speaker: agent

10:45
For sure, EGMAD is the best course out there.
Speaker: agent

10:48
We have the we, we deliver the most number of success stories.
Speaker: agent

10:51
Definitely look, consider EGMAD, but do your research and choose any other course if you think that is the right fit for you.
Speaker: agent

10:57
No problem at all.
Speaker: agent

10:58
I'm not pushing EGMAD course here.
Speaker: agent

11:00
You do your research and choose another course as well.
Speaker: agent

11:02
But definitely you need a full-fledged course.
Speaker: agent

11:05
That book, you have to do that book, but somewhere in middle, not as the entire thing.
Speaker: agent

11:10
So that is a big thing here.
Speaker: agent

11:12
So what I will do right now is I'll take the next 15 minutes.
Speaker: agent

11:17
Let's discuss the exact strategy for the next 45 days, what needs to be done.
Speaker: agent

11:23
We'll understand the overall philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

11:26
I will also share my screen.
Speaker: agent

11:27
I'll show you the EG MAD course modules.
Speaker: agent

11:29
That way you understand if you're an EG MAD student, exactly how you can do the course.
Speaker: agent

11:34
So basically right now, let's assume that you're an EG MAD student.
Speaker: agent

11:37
Let's see how you would prepare for the next 45 days.
Speaker: agent

11:39
That way you'll have two things.
Speaker: agent

11:41
One is you'll understand the entire philosophy of how to study for the 45 days.
Speaker: agent

11:45
You will also see the AG Mat modules.
Speaker: agent

11:47
If you think the entire logic makes sense, you can obviously go with the AG Mat course so that that part is always there.
Speaker: agent

11:52
We will do that.
Speaker: agent

11:53
And during this discussion, if you have any questions, stop me at any point and ask a question.
Speaker: agent

11:58
OK, OK, that that will do.
Speaker: prospect

12:00
So I'm sharing the screen.
Speaker: agent

12:02
Let me know if you can see it.
Speaker: agent

12:04
Is this visible?
Speaker: agent

12:05
Yeah, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

12:08
Oh, OK.
Speaker: agent

12:08
All right, so this is how your typical EG MAD course dashboard looks like.
Speaker: agent

12:12
One should log in as a student, bunch of learning modules, quizzing, platform, mock test, everything would be there.
Speaker: agent

12:19
But yeah, we'll, we'll not worry about all of them.
Speaker: agent

12:21
We'll talk about the philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

12:23
So step \#1 is that you have to take a full-fledged mock test at the beginning of your journey, right?
Speaker: agent

12:31
Right away, you'll have to take a full-fledged mock test because you want to get to 7:05.
Speaker: agent

12:36
Fine, we'll get there.
Speaker: agent

12:37
But where are you currently?
Speaker: agent

12:38
Are you at a 555 score?
Speaker: agent

12:39
Are you at a 505?
Speaker: agent

12:41
Are you at a 605495?
Speaker: agent

12:42
Because your starting score will determine the entire action plan for you.
Speaker: agent

12:47
So step \#1 you'll have to take a mock test.
Speaker: agent

12:49
So for example, let me click on this here.
Speaker: agent

12:51
These are the Sigma X mock tests.
Speaker: agent

12:53
So if you're an AG mad student, you'll go and you'll take the mock test \#1 if you look at this student, the student took a mock test, got a 595 to begin with.
Speaker: agent

13:01
He's executed the entire study plan.
Speaker: agent

13:04
Got to 715-7051.
Speaker: agent

13:06
The mock test on the real GMAT as well.
Speaker: agent

13:08
Go to a 705.
Speaker: agent

13:09
That's how your journey would look like.
Speaker: agent

13:10
Mock test \#1 would be a low score, but the other mock test will be high scores because you executed the study plan like that.
Speaker: agent

13:16
That, that, that is the idea.
Speaker: agent

13:18
Now what we are looking for in mock test number one is you have a 595 score.
Speaker: agent

13:22
Let's say, OK, fine, 595.
Speaker: agent

13:25
Within that 595, what is your verbal percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:28
What is your quant percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:30
What is your data insights percentile?
Speaker: agent

13:32
We want to know that.
Speaker: agent

13:33
Now when I look at this, I can clearly say that this student is naturally weaker on the verbal side, but this guy has good skills by default in data insights.
Speaker: agent

13:42
Naturally, this guy is stronger there in your case as well.
Speaker: agent

13:45
We'll see.
Speaker: agent

13:46
Handily speaking, what do you think about your strengths and weaknesses?
Speaker: agent

13:49
Verbal, quant and data insights, how would they be?
Speaker: agent

13:53
Are you comfortable in quant or verbal?
Speaker: agent

13:56
Verbal and both you're you would be comfortable.
Speaker: prospect

14:01
Is that what you're saying?
Speaker: agent

14:02
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

14:04
OK.
Speaker: agent

14:04
So there is no specific strength and weaknesses.
Speaker: agent

14:06
Probably everything could be a good area.
Speaker: agent

14:08
That's what you're saying.
Speaker: agent

14:10
Data in text.
Speaker: prospect

14:12
I, I'm a little confused, but OK, Data insights could be probably a weak area because you're not familiar with those type of questions.
Speaker: prospect

14:22
Maybe.
Speaker: prospect

14:23
Yeah, that's why probably.
Speaker: prospect

14:24
OK, we'll see.
Speaker: agent

14:25
So when you take the mock test, that observation gets quantified.
Speaker: agent

14:29
So you might get a very low score in data insights in the mock test, but get a good score in verbal and probably we'll see that.
Speaker: agent

14:35
Now another thing which we which the mock test will tell us is within Verbal in CR and RC, what are the current percentile scores?
Speaker: agent

14:44
Maybe in Verbal, you are naturally good and critical reasoning, you get a higher starting score, but you are slightly on the weaker side.
Speaker: agent

14:51
On reading comprehension, we'll get to know that.
Speaker: agent

14:53
Similarly in quant as well, we'll get to see your percentiles in algebra and arithmetic.
Speaker: agent

14:58
When you take the real GMAT or a mock test on https://www.google.com/search?q=officialmba.com, you'll get the same results, similar results where all these data points.
Speaker: agent

15:06
So in the in the EGMAT mock test as well, we are giving all these data points.
Speaker: agent

15:10
So data insights have these four types of sections.
Speaker: agent

15:13
All these sections you'll have starting scores.
Speaker: agent

15:15
This is step number number one.
Speaker: agent

15:16
Take a mock test, 2 1/2 hours, proper ideals conditions, you'll sit and you'll take a mock test.
Speaker: agent

15:22
This would happen.
Speaker: agent

15:22
This is step number one.
Speaker: agent

15:24
Step \#2 is that you'll spend 5 to 10 minutes on this tool called Personalized Study Planner tool.
Speaker: agent

15:30
It will take the entire mock test score as an input, which will ask you some other questions as well.
Speaker: agent

15:35
At the end, you will see a framework that looks something like this.
Speaker: agent

15:39
This is the main study plan framework here.
Speaker: agent

15:42
This is the dummy study plan I created for a different student.
Speaker: agent

15:45
I will will not worry about that.
Speaker: agent

15:47
We'll, we'll worry about the philosophy of it.
Speaker: agent

15:49
What exactly does this mean and why?
Speaker: agent

15:51
Why it is important for you.
Speaker: agent

15:53
So in this student's case, 545 is the starting score.
Speaker: agent

15:56
This student wants to get to 695.
Speaker: agent

15:58
In your case, you want to get to 705, little bit higher score, but 695 also is good for us.
Speaker: agent

16:03
If you get a 695, that's more than good enough.
Speaker: agent

16:06
We'll we'll accept that now.
Speaker: agent

16:09
Number one is that on the left hand side, you'll see all these current scores.
Speaker: agent

16:15
This student is slightly stronger in critical reasoning, weaker in reading comprehension, slightly stronger in arithmetic, little bit weaker in algebra.
Speaker: agent

16:24
That's what these numbers mean.
Speaker: agent

16:26
Now to get to a 695, there are specific targets.
Speaker: agent

16:30
Because you are stronger in critical reasoning, you are given a bigger target score, and because you are weaker in reading comprehension, you are given a smaller target score.
Speaker: agent

16:39
So somewhere a very high target score, somewhere slightly lower target score.
Speaker: agent

16:43
But the combination of all these numbers together will give us that 695 the tool determines automatically.
Speaker: agent

16:51
And this is this step is very important because you will get to your overall target in less amount of time.
Speaker: agent

16:57
If you customize your targets in your stronger area, you need less time to get a higher score.
Speaker: agent

17:02
In your weaker area, you're not even aiming for a higher score.
Speaker: agent

17:05
So you'll get done faster.
Speaker: agent

17:06
That's the idea.
Speaker: agent

17:07
So this this part is very important.
Speaker: agent

17:10
Then we, we can actually tell this tool that I can study 4 hours every day, you know, weekends I can study a little bit more amount of time, I can study 38 hours on a weekly basis.
Speaker: agent

17:22
If I study at that rate, by when can I take the GMAT?
Speaker: agent

17:27
How much time will I need for GMAT?
Speaker: agent

17:28
For example, this student can take the GMAT by 26th of March at that rate of time investment.
Speaker: agent

17:37
So if you start the preparation right away, you can take the GMAT by 26th of March.
Speaker: agent

17:41
But I want to take the GMAT by you, you, I, I means you, you have to take the GMAT by 15th of March or 14th of March, little bit earlier, right?
Speaker: agent

17:52
So how can, how would you do that?
Speaker: agent

17:54
So what you will have to do is you will have to beat the clock.
Speaker: agent

17:57
For example, in critical reasoning, it will take about 1 1/2 weeks to get to a 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

18:03
1 1/2 weeks is what, 8 days or so.
Speaker: agent

18:05
So if you start the critical reasoning preparation today, on day eight you will have a 90th percentile, but you need to try and achieve give that 90th percentile not on day 8 but on day six.
Speaker: agent

18:17
You have to save two days time.
Speaker: agent

18:18
Similarly in reading comprehension, you have to save two days time.
Speaker: agent

18:21
In arithmetic you have to save a couple of days time.
Speaker: agent

18:23
If you do that then you will you will hit that 15th of March deadline.
Speaker: agent

18:28
That is the idea.
Speaker: agent

18:30
So that that is number 1 \#2 let's say you don't have a 545, let's say you have a 605 scores to begin with.
Speaker: agent

18:38
Then then automatically the tool itself will tell you that you can get ready by 13th of March.
Speaker: agent

18:43
So the more score improvement we need, the more amount of effort it takes to get a higher score.
Speaker: agent

18:50
That that's the only thing.
Speaker: agent

18:51
So that's the idea.
Speaker: agent

18:53
So if if the if the tool is saying you have to take the GMAT little bit farther than your target GMAT score, the only way to achieve your target by March 15th is by saving some time in every subsection.
Speaker: agent

19:06
That that is the idea.
Speaker: agent

19:07
There.
Speaker: agent

19:08
Now this part is clear, right?
Speaker: agent

19:10
The timeline part, yeah.
Speaker: prospect

19:12
Now coming to the overall execution part of it, because you're a beginner to the preparation as of now.
Speaker: agent

19:20
In the beginning, first 2-3 weeks, you should try to focus on one thing at a time.
Speaker: agent

19:26
You should not mix things up.
Speaker: agent

19:28
That means this is how it will go tomorrow, Tomorrow only you'll kind of have to make a decision and start actually, unfortunately we don't have any time.
Speaker: agent

19:35
So I'm saying tomorrow.
Speaker: agent

19:36
Tomorrow you'll start the preparation with verbal.
Speaker: agent

19:38
Within verbal, you'll start the preparation with critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

19:41
And for the next entire one week, only critical reasoning, nothing else.
Speaker: agent

19:46
No RC, no quant, no data inserts, complete focus on critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

19:50
To become an expert in critical reasoning, At the end of that one week, we will give you a bunch of tests.
Speaker: agent

19:56
In all those tests, you have to get this 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

19:59
If that happens, you're done with CR.
Speaker: agent

20:02
That is the idea there, what what to do in that one week.
Speaker: agent

20:05
I'll show it to you.
Speaker: agent

20:05
But that's the idea.
Speaker: agent

20:06
So start tomorrow, spend one week on critical reasoning, get to a 90th percentile score, then come to reading comprehension.
Speaker: agent

20:14
Spend another one week on reading comprehension, get to an 80th percentile score, then go to quant.
Speaker: agent

20:19
In quant again, you'll spend another two weeks, arithmetic first, then algebra, and you'll try to achieve these target scores.
Speaker: agent

20:25
But here when you are studying two weeks for quant, you won't you won't just leave verbal aside you during the weekends you will spend little bit more time and take some verbal mock tests.
Speaker: agent

20:39
That way you'll stay in touch with the verbal topic without forgetting about it and the scores also should be good.
Speaker: agent

20:44
Then we'll come to data insights.
Speaker: agent

20:46
You're not fully familiar with data insights, so we'll spend about 3 weeks or so in data insights and the one topic at a time we'll pick up, We'll try to achieve the target scores.
Speaker: agent

20:55
And while doing data insights for three weeks, every weekend you will take verbal and quant sectional mock test together back-to-back.
Speaker: agent

21:04
So that way you are trying to build the stamina for the main test as well.
Speaker: agent

21:07
Every year earlier you handled only verbal tests.
Speaker: agent

21:10
Now we are adding quant tests into the mix.
Speaker: agent

21:12
Then we will add data data insert tests into the mix as well.
Speaker: agent

21:16
Then finally we'll take the full length mock tests like that.
Speaker: agent

21:19
So in the EG MAT course, you have about 55 zero sectional mock tests.
Speaker: agent

21:24
You won't take all of them, no need to take all of them, but they are there and you have the full length mock tests as well.
Speaker: agent

21:29
So that's how it is how, how to divide the next 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

21:33
That was clear, right?
Speaker: agent

21:34
Two weeks for verbal, 2 weeks for quant, 3 weeks for data inserts like that.
Speaker: agent

21:37
OK, now let's go to the execution part.
Speaker: agent

21:42
So I said start the preparation tomorrow with critical reasoning and with verbal and within one week wrap it up.
Speaker: agent

21:49
So exactly how that one week would look like.
Speaker: agent

21:51
I'll give you that understanding.
Speaker: agent

21:53
That way you'll have a much more clearer picture.
Speaker: agent

21:55
So whatever the learning architecture that we discussed for critical reasoning right now, the learning architecture remains same for every other topic as well.
Speaker: agent

22:05
So that that that part is there.
Speaker: agent

22:07
Now let's go and see the critical reasoning part.
Speaker: agent

22:10
So let's go to this verbal and master.
Speaker: agent

22:15
So critical reasoning is here.
Speaker: agent

22:17
We'll have to start the preparation with critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

22:21
Right now we are interested in learning a bunch of things and practicing a bunch of things in critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

22:28
Then we will do the testing part.
Speaker: agent

22:29
The stage \#2 is the testing part.
Speaker: agent

23:23
So master comprehension, you'll spend about 2 hours to 2 1/2 hours roughly.
Speaker: agent

23:31
That's how much time it will take.
Speaker: agent

23:33
This is not a very huge course.
Speaker: agent

23:35
It's a very short course.
Speaker: agent

23:37
In that two hours you would learn everything about why you make errors in general while solving questions that requires reading or reading comprehension question, critical reasoning question, a text based data insight question, even quant word problems where you have to read the question statement.
Speaker: agent

23:51
How do you read it in a proper way, extract the information needed from it?
Speaker: agent

23:56
All these things are discussed in master comprehension.
Speaker: agent

23:59
It's just two hours of course.
Speaker: agent

24:01
So master comprehension is important if your verbal score is low.
Speaker: agent

24:06
Then you'll come to critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

24:09
Within critical reasoning you'll spend some time on this first module, this topic called pre thinking.
Speaker: agent

24:14
So this pre thinking is what it's a methodology that we teach to solve a critical reasoning question.
Speaker: agent

24:22
So for example, if you see a critical reasoning question, you should never jump to the option choices directly.
Speaker: agent

24:27
That's a very bad way of solving a CR question.
Speaker: agent

24:30
If you do that, you'll always, you know, find that two option choices look very close to each other.
Speaker: agent

24:37
And when you choose one of them, the chances of getting it incorrect is very high.
Speaker: agent

24:41
So what we teach is you should always read the question statement, make sure you understand the question statement, extract the main information, then look at the question type, assumption question, inference question.
Speaker: agent

24:54
Based on the question type, then you will predict the answer.
Speaker: agent

24:58
You should spend some time to predict the answer before looking at the options and then you will look for the options.
Speaker: agent

25:05
That that's the overall structure.
Speaker: agent

25:07
This is called pre thinking.
Speaker: agent

25:09
You'll spend some time on this module first.
Speaker: agent

25:12
OK, so it's a methodology driven approach we are trying to do.
Speaker: agent

25:17
You'll spend some time, then you will learn about the different types of questions in critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

25:22
Inference type question, conclusion type questions, bold phase questions.
Speaker: agent

25:27
You'll learn about that.
Speaker: agent

25:28
How to solve these question types?
Speaker: agent

25:31
Because the methodology would change a little bit.
Speaker: agent

25:34
You'll learn about all these sub topics in the next one week time and you'll become good at it.
Speaker: agent

25:40
You'll take some small quizzes as you can see there are bunch of quizzes here.
Speaker: agent

25:44
Practice quiz one, practice quiz two.
Speaker: agent

25:47
You'll take those quizzes.
Speaker: agent

25:49
And by the end of one week, you should feel very confident in critical reasoning and should be ready to achieve that 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

25:57
And of course, we are going to test you there.
Speaker: agent

26:00
At the end of one week you'll take these topic wise custom quizzes.
Speaker: agent

26:05
These are sectional tests within critical reasoning.
Speaker: agent

26:07
You'll take these and you'll have to score above 90th percentile.
Speaker: agent

26:10
That's the idea there.
Speaker: agent

26:11
So you take two of them.
Speaker: agent

26:13
This one has 16 questions and this one has 12 questions.
Speaker: agent

26:17
You have to achieve above 90 percentile.
Speaker: agent

26:19
That is the idea for CR.
Speaker: agent

26:21
So at the end of one week, you should be completely done with CR with a 90th percentile score.
Speaker: agent

26:27
That's how it is.
Speaker: agent

26:28
Now you will come to reading comprehension.
Speaker: agent

26:30
The same thing will happen.
Speaker: agent

26:33
You will again learn the right methodology to solve RC questions.
Speaker: agent

26:38
Then you will learn about the different types of questions in RC.
Speaker: agent

26:42
And then you will take the quizzes and you'll have to achieve an 80th percentile score or higher than that.
Speaker: agent

26:49
You will take about a week's time to get ready with reading comprehension.
Speaker: agent

26:53
So that means two weeks time, you're done with verbal.
Speaker: agent

26:56
By that time, you're done with verbal and you'll have a score of 80th percentile or higher for verbal.
Speaker: agent

27:01
That would be a very good score to have to get to a 705.
Speaker: agent

27:06
Got it.
Speaker: prospect

27:06
Understood.
Speaker: agent

27:07
Now once verbal is done, you're not going to leave it.
Speaker: agent

27:10
Every weekend you will take one verbal sectional test to stay in touch with the topic.
Speaker: agent

27:17
Then you will move on to quant.
Speaker: agent

27:19
Same thing would happen.
Speaker: agent

27:21
Arithmetic.
Speaker: agent

27:22
You'll learn about concepts, method, practice, everything will happen.
Speaker: agent

27:26
And here in arithmetic we have some different type of sections as well.
Speaker: agent

27:30
Algebra will come algebra course also is very extensive.
Speaker: agent

27:34
You'll learn about the right methodologies to solve very complex algebra questions.
Speaker: agent

27:39
All those things will happen.
Speaker: agent

27:42
You'll spend about two weeks for quant and then you'll achieve the target scores in quant section.
Speaker: agent

27:48
So now you have four weeks of preparation.
Speaker: agent

27:50
You are done with verbal and quant and during this quant preparation, you will take some verbal sectional quizzes as well to stay in touch.
Speaker: agent

27:59
Now you'll come to data insights.
Speaker: agent

28:02
You'll spend about three weeks for data insights.
Speaker: agent

28:05
Each and every topic within data insights, you'll give proper amount of time.
Speaker: agent

28:10
And then you'll take the test for each and every topic.
Speaker: agent

28:13
And you'll achieve the target scores in data insights.
Speaker: agent

28:16
And during data insights preparation, you'll also take verbal and quant sectional tests in your weekends.
Speaker: agent

28:24
You have about five weeks of preparation in total now.
Speaker: agent

28:28
And now it's time for you to take the full length mock test.
Speaker: agent

28:31
So this is week number five.
Speaker: agent

28:34
Week number six and seven, you'll take these full length mock tests and the official mock tests, and then you'll keep track of your performance.
Speaker: agent

28:44
And then you should be able to get a score of 695 or 705 plus.
Speaker: agent

28:48
And at the end of the journey, you'll take the real GMAT and you'll get your score in the last 1 1/2 week.
Speaker: agent

28:54
You will be busy with mock tests, mock analysis, fixing the weaknesses, retaking the mock test.
Speaker: agent

29:01
That would be the entire journey.
Speaker: agent

29:03
So overall it would take about 6 to 7 weeks.
Speaker: agent

29:07
Which is exactly 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

29:09
So if you start tomorrow, by March 15th you'll be done with all the mock tests and everything should be good.
Speaker: agent

29:16
So this is the overall plan.
Speaker: agent

29:18
Do you have any questions with respect to this plan?
Speaker: agent

29:21
This is a very general plan that we generally follow for most of our students.
Speaker: agent

29:26
And that is why the study planner is important, because based on your current score, it will tell you that whether you need to spend six weeks or eight weeks of time or seven weeks of time.
Speaker: agent

29:35
How much time you should spend for each and every section, what should be your target score.
Speaker: agent

29:39
All those things are quantified right away.
Speaker: agent

29:43
Got it.
Speaker: prospect

29:43
Understood.
Speaker: agent

29:45
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

29:45
Any questions with respect to the study plan?
Speaker: agent

29:48
What's the process?
Speaker: agent

29:50
What to do, what not to do?
Speaker: agent

29:52
Any question at all?
Speaker: agent

29:55
Nope.
Speaker: prospect

29:55
I, I'm okay with that.
Speaker: prospect

29:57
OK, all right.
Speaker: agent

29:59
So now coming to the last part of this entire discussion, which is about EGMAD course.
Speaker: agent

30:05
Right?
Speaker: agent

30:06
You want to consider the EGMAT course, I assume.
Speaker: agent

30:09
Is that the case or no?
Speaker: agent

30:11
Are you just looking for the study plan strategy from this discussion?
Speaker: agent

30:17
No, no, I am.
Speaker: prospect

30:18
No, I'm thinking of a course.
Speaker: prospect

30:20
Got it.
Speaker: agent

30:21
So EGMAD is probably a consideration here.
Speaker: agent

30:24
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

30:25
OK, alright.
Speaker: agent

30:26
So I already told you that EGMAD has a 2-month course, 4-month course and six-month course.
Speaker: agent

30:33
Since you have a 1 1/2 month timeline, obviously the 2-month course is the ideal choice for you.
Speaker: agent

30:39
Right now, if you go to the EG MAD website, I can do it right away.
Speaker: agent

30:43
Let's see.
Speaker: agent

30:45
Let's let's verify that information together.
Speaker: agent

30:49
Plans and pricing.
Speaker: agent

30:52
It's going to open up here.
Speaker: agent

30:55
This is the one I'm talking about.
Speaker: agent

30:57
Can you see the screen?
Speaker: agent

30:59
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

31:00
So there is a 2-month 4-month 6-month option.
Speaker: agent

31:03
So you need to choose the 2-month option.
Speaker: agent

31:06
This option is at $199.
Speaker: agent

31:09
This is the new course.
Speaker: agent

31:12
The prices are on the higher side.
Speaker: agent

31:15
But let me show you the current pricing on the Indian side of it.
Speaker: agent

31:21
Is this visible?
Speaker: agent

31:23
Yes.
Speaker: prospect

31:24
OK.
Speaker: agent

31:25
So right now we have an offer going on.
Speaker: agent

31:28
I'm sharing the screen here.
Speaker: agent

31:31
Yes.
Speaker: prospect

31:32
It's at 17,999.
Speaker: agent

31:35
This is like around $220, $230.
Speaker: agent

31:40
So we have another discount which will be available tomorrow.
Speaker: agent

31:45
Which is going to be 15,999 for the 2-month course.
Speaker: agent

31:51
So you'll have to basically go for the 2-month course.
Speaker: agent

31:56
The 2-month course also has a free extension plan.
Speaker: agent

32:00
So for example, if you, you know, because you're starting from very scratch, right?
Speaker: agent

32:05
You're starting from 0 you're saying that you haven't started.
Speaker: agent

32:08
So let's say after 2 months you took a mock test and you didn't get your target score.
Speaker: agent

32:14
And then you're like, I need a little bit more time, right?
Speaker: agent

32:17
So we have a free extension for 2-month as well.
Speaker: agent

32:20
If you want to use that.
Speaker: agent

32:21
So the 2-month course can be converted into a 4-month course if you need more time.
Speaker: agent

32:27
So we have that facility as well.
Speaker: agent

32:30
OK.
Speaker: prospect

32:31
So that part is there.
Speaker: agent

32:32
And other than that, let's say you're an EGMAD student, you'll have everything, 24/7 access to the mentors.
Speaker: agent

32:41
You can ask any questions to them.
Speaker: agent

32:43
They'll resolve all your queries.
Speaker: agent

32:45
So that part is also there.
Speaker: agent

32:46
So that's the thing.
Speaker: agent

32:48
And the course price also seems to be good.
Speaker: agent

32:51
Tomorrow onwards, there will be a new discount.
Speaker: agent

32:54
What else do you want to know about the course?
Speaker: agent

32:57
Do you have any specific concerns?
Speaker: agent

32:59
No, no, I am good.
Speaker: prospect

33:01
Good.
Speaker: prospect

33:02
I'm just thinking about the dates.
Speaker: prospect

33:05
Like if I miss out this date, then I'll have to apply next year.
Speaker: prospect

33:10
It's something like that.
Speaker: prospect

33:11
Yes, yes, correct.
Speaker: agent

33:13
So that means this deadline is absolutely a firm deadline, and you have to ensure that you wrap it up by this.
Speaker: agent

33:20
Right?
Speaker: agent

33:21
Yeah, for sure.
Speaker: prospect

33:22
Correct.
Speaker: agent

33:23
There is no plan to push it by another three months.
Speaker: agent

33:27
That's why 1 1/2 month means 1 1/2 month.
Speaker: agent

33:30
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

33:31
OK, that part is there.
Speaker: agent

33:33
And anything else do you want to ask?
Speaker: agent

33:36
Nope.
Speaker: prospect

33:37
I guess we covered everything.
Speaker: prospect

33:40
Right, right.
Speaker: agent

33:42
Yes, we have covered all the major aspects here.
Speaker: agent

33:45
So yeah, so we talked about ISB goals, we talked about GMAT score goal, we talked about the 1 1/2 month timeline, we talked about the study plan, everything.
Speaker: agent

33:53
So you just have to do your research.
Speaker: agent

33:55
If you want to read some reviews about EGMAD, just go to GMAT Club and search for EG Mat reviews.
Speaker: agent

34:02
You will get a bunch of reviews, more than a thousand reviews are there.
Speaker: agent

34:05
You can read them.
Speaker: agent

34:06
You can read some reviews on our website as well.
Speaker: agent

34:09
So do your research first, and then make a proper decision before you, you know, go for it.
Speaker: agent

34:15
But definitely you need a course, that's what I said.
Speaker: agent

34:17
OK, I'm thinking of joining the course.
Speaker: prospect

34:20
OK, you're thinking of joining the course.
Speaker: agent

34:22
Good, so I'll send you an email.
Speaker: agent

34:25
I will share the details of this two-month course pricing and I'll also try to share the link for tomorrow's pricing itself.
Speaker: agent

34:33
Right away that way you can access it and get started.
Speaker: agent

34:36
Right?
Speaker: agent

34:38
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

34:39
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

34:41
And are there any other questions?
Speaker: agent

34:44
No.
Speaker: prospect

34:44
I'm fine.
Speaker: prospect

34:45
OK, alright.
Speaker: agent

34:47
It was a pleasure talking to you.
Speaker: agent

34:49
All the best for your GMAT journey.
Speaker: agent

34:52
You will definitely achieve it.
Speaker: agent

34:54
Just stick to the plan that we discussed today, and you'll be there.
Speaker: agent

34:57
Thank you so much for your time.
Speaker: agent

34:59
Thank you.
Speaker: prospect

35:00
Bye.
Speaker: agent

35:01
Bye.
Speaker: prospect

35:03
So I want to share the pricing.
Speaker: agent

35:05
And I'll send you an email.
Speaker: agent

35:06
It will be at 15,999.
Speaker: agent

35:09
It should be fine.
Speaker: agent

35:11
I'll, I'll send you that link right away.
Speaker: agent

35:13
That way you don't have to wait.
Speaker: agent

35:15
OK.
Speaker: prospect

35:16
And then if you have any other questions, you can always connect back to me.
Speaker: agent

35:20
The other thing which is there.
Speaker: agent

35:22
So I think your main objective, you want to get 705 or higher than that in March.
