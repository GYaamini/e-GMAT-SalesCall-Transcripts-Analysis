2:23
Hey, , , you are on mute if you are talking.

2:32
Hello.

2:33
Yeah, hi.

2:34
Hello.

2:35
Yeah, .

2:36
So, yeah, so we had a fair level first, you know, first level discussion in WhatsApp where you said you just starting your prep and want to take in the month of July.

2:47
Yeah.

2:48
So, so a couple of things I would like to ask is you are currently working Apna?

2:53
Yeah, I am currently working.

2:54
I have an experience of around 6 years.

2:58
OK, OK, that's good.

2:59
that's good.

3:00
And so, so I just want to understand you are looking for the round one application if I am not round one application for this year, right?

3:11
Yeah, round one application.

3:12
what's your target schools?

3:14
My target schools are ISPI am also exploring the IIM.

3:20
I am BGP, PGPX and also NCI at Singapore.

3:26
OK, so majorly India is specific and then yeah, NCR is one option for you.

3:32
Mostly I am going towards India.

3:35
OK, understood.

3:37
So even even say ISV offers up to 100% scholarship and wrong applications for the great team as go.

3:44
So you know, you have that, you know, right now at least you're not in the month of say April of May, You are at least the month of February so that you would have Apple Railway to actually, you know, prepare and get it started.

3:58
So before this, have you taken any test or no, just coming out of group.

4:04
I haven't taken any test.

4:06
I gave cat when I was in college like back in 2018 and gotten percentile of 77 if I remember.

4:16
OK alright so so in this call I assume that you updated Naive 2 even you know you have done a basic research about eating right?

4:27
But still I would like to give you an overview.

4:30
So, you know, before I give a complete understanding, I, I would be sharing you 2 short videos, very short videos which you have to watch to understand at a surface level in a very concentrated way that because it is in a very short video comprising of a lot of things.

4:49
And when I after that you would have some questions invoked in you.

4:53
And when I explain you things, then it will be a bit more clearer rather than I am just maybe just directly started.

4:59
So I will send you that right now in that in the chat box, just, you know, check that out.

5:08
I am just mentioning as video one and video 2 for that order.

5:14
So I have send a video one.

5:17
The video one is regarding the course overview and video 2 is regarding the mental support.

5:22
We have a dedicated mental support for our program.

5:25
So how how does this work?

5:27
You would have some questions once you finish it, but of course I am there to you know, help you with that.

5:31
So yeah.

5:33
So these are the 2 videos which you can watch right now.

5:38
We will be on mute.

5:38
I will be waiting for you.

5:40
So once you are done just unmute and say hi.

5:42
I will.

5:43
I will.

5:43
We will discuss at that point.

5:46
OK, Yeah, I will watch and I will let you know.

5:50
Sure, sure.

5:50
I will be here.

5:51
Yeah.

19:41
Hi, Amrit.

19:46
Hello.

19:47
Yeah, Yeah, I went to these videos.

19:50
Yeah.

19:51
So I hope that would have given you a fair understanding of how we are going to approach the GMAT as a whole.

19:57
And yeah.

19:58
So what do you feel?

19:59
So you know, what is it that you have got from the video, Kavina?

20:04
Yeah, I understood like the complete walkthrough of what things are there, How?

20:09
Right.

20:10
I can have a look at the videos, classes, the Marks and how the mentor will help me and give me the like the agenda, right?

20:18
Both of the things I need to focus on.

20:21
Correct, correct.

20:22
And also as you progress your journey, you are going to leave a trail of data footprints which is being utilised for, you know for for your last leg of your breath.

20:33
Yeah, that is see the mentorship program you have already seen in that video you know majorly through emails and chats and that is only till phase one.

20:42
So the complete mentorship for the complete prep is divided to 2 phases.

20:46
Phase one is still you reach a particular level of around 8080 to 80 percentile, around 6.5625 is when you would have phase one and then Phase 2.

20:56
So what happens in phase one is once you hit that particular 80 to 85 percentile, what as an output, what what can we expect is you would by then know how to solve all questions because GMAT unlike CAT or other tests where you know you have to have the very depth of understanding.

21:12
Here the depth is from the focus.

21:13
Here the technique is the focus because the depth is very shallow, right.

21:16
There are very limited types of questions that can ever come in your GMAT.

21:20
And once you identify those types and you know work on it, there is nothing new that you are going to see for your first time in your test.

21:27
But all that matters is having that high optimised efficiency.

21:31
So the first objective ways to make sure that you know how to solve all questions may be not.

21:36
If not, see the average time that you would require or you would get for solving questions in G matrix around 2 minutes.

21:43
For verbal, you have 23 questions for 45 minutes, just about 2 minutes.

21:47
Quants 21 minutes, you know just below 2 minutes.

21:50
And for quants 21 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.

21:54
And data insights, again 20 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.

21:58
So on an average if you just see it is all you know close to 2 minutes of time is what you would have for your test the reason of your question.

22:06
So even if you take 33 and a half minutes on an average or 3 minutes on an average, its OK if you are getting the right answer in the phase one.

22:14
So that is the objective.

22:15
There are 64 questions, at least 63 to 64 questions or at least in the worst case 62 questions you should be able to solve in that you know relax time environment and till then you would have your mental support majorly via you know.

22:30
I will share my screen also for for you to have an understanding if I if I take say a critical tracing or any of the sections.

22:39
Yeah, this is the chat window.

22:41
You know that that they are going to have where you know whenever you ping your mentor, you are going to get a pop up.

22:47
They are going to get a pop up and they ping you.

22:48
You are going to get a pop up and whenever it is not just in chat, you are also going to get a mail of it.

22:54
So you know you are going to get the communication recorded in your mail by default.

22:59
So that is going to be there and you know chat does not necessarily mean typing.

23:03
It could be the loop videos which which you know you have just watched our loop videos.

23:07
So it would not take much time for your mentor to create a short loop video to explain you rather than just typing and creating a confusion.

23:14
So you know, generally we prefer that and if it is something pretty straightforward, we will just type and send it to you as well.

23:20
So that is how it is going to be in phase one and once you enter Phase 2 that is once you reach a capability to solve all questions that comes in front of you, you require a dedicated you know, you know structure or a strategy to now get all the questions in under less than 2 minutes.

23:39
And how does it happen?

23:40
It happens through our flagship program called the Last Mile Push.

23:43
So you know when we say it is a program, it is a different program.

23:46
You know don't get into the things that it is going to be additional charge.

23:50
It is inclusive within the course because what we believe is nobody enrolls in a course for you know, getting a 615 rates everyone gets in a course, you know gets gets a course for getting a high score.

24:01
So we don't charge anything extra for it.

24:04
But the idea is once you start or you know, the idea is the first objective that you need to get is to hit that particular personnel to be eligible for this.

24:16
And all all the students that you would see if you have follow, if you have been following us on YouTube, you would have seen that we are actually having the highest number of success rate compared to almost the top global platforms you went towards from the second test.

24:30
And, and everybody that you would see in our YouTube channel.

24:33
I will I will just quickly show you as well that you know, the you know, they have gone through the last minute push program where you would have one on one session with your mentors.

24:41
Beyond that, once you are once you enter the last minute push program, it will not be chat or meal, but it will be one on one session that you would have a with your mentor where the complete agenda is for fine tuning and time management.

24:52
That will be the only focus in the last minute push program.

24:55
So, so some students directly enrolled for last week which program also who already have given their actual test.

25:02
And this is one of the students who got a 625 in an actual test and you know, joined us.

25:09
She gave, she had she was running on deadline, had only around 17 days and had another test.

25:15
She joined us for 15 days and and got to a 695 score.

25:21
So, you know, we have a lot of scenarios and we have students who get 725 just you just need to do only one thing.

25:28
If you are looking for a 700 plus, see just to give you a context, you know the median of the median score for ISB is 655.

25:35
For I, I, Ms is also around 655.

25:38
And for NCR the median score is around 675685.

25:42
You need to score, you need to plan at least 2030 points on top of the median score to get an interview call.

25:49
And for ISB, if you are targeting a 715 or like A908909 percentile, you can get up to 100% scholarships also.

25:56
So that should be a focus provided the time frame that you have got right.

26:01
So we have a lot of such examples.

26:03
We would find a lot of students who are getting A908909 percentile on a monthly basis.

26:08
You would find plenty.

26:10
So you know that is one thing.

26:11
And regarding GMAT Club, which is the world's largest community of all the GMAT aspirin sectors of globe, you would find, you know, we having the highest number of reviews, verified reviews for getting posted 2.8 K.

26:26
The second best is TDP.

26:27
You would find it is almost half.

26:30
And then you would find the average rating is 4.7 out of 5.

26:33
And almost everyone would be talking about how the last mail push program has been helpful and how the journey has been helpful throughout their prep and all these things.

26:42
So just you also give you a context.

26:44
I would like to show you one of the students, you know, who came back to prep after a really long time.

26:54
So let me just open it up to somewhere here.

26:59
So he came back after 20 years of work eggs.

27:03
You know, when when someone comes back after 20 years of work eggs, you know, you would pretty much be, you know, you pretty much understand that, you know, they, they are practically starting from that Ground Zero.

27:14
So this is one of the students who came back to prep after, you know, around 19 years of work case after 20 years that he came back to academics and got to a score of 685.

27:27
And there are other examples as well who have done that, who has done that in their journey.

27:32
So, so most people will talk about how the Olympic program has been successful where, you know, like the way I said, no extra cost provided you are already at a good level that is around 80th percentile level.

27:42
So to boost a peer score and this is also another student who came after 20 years of work eggs, you know, so when these people can do anybody can do that, that is the idea.

27:55
So you know, when someone gets 20 plus years of experience can come in and you know, crack it and get A6856959798 percentile, you know, we we can do because it is it is a standard process that has to follow.

28:09
We cover from the fundamentals.

28:10
But of course, even if you look at quants, let us assume that if it is quants, maybe there is a fact that you know, you may not know.

28:19
Say let us assume that 60% of things, so 70% of the things you do not know, at least 3030% of the things you might remember it, you might know.

28:25
So what we have in the quantity is something called personalised adaptive course engine, we call it PACE.

28:30
What it does is within each of the modules, you would have a diagnostic quiz.

28:34
Based on how you perform in the diagnostic quiz, we capture multiple data, your average correct time, incorrect time, accuracy, time pressure management, all these things and then recommend you to take only those particular files where you are going to have a definitive learning.

28:47
And we are going to recommend you to skip the files which you have already mastered or you are already a master it.

28:53
So by that way you are not spending.

28:55
Suppose here you got 100 percentage recommended none here you got 100 percentage but still recommended to the files because maybe you know how to solve the question.

29:03
But if you attend these 2 files, you are going to have a better technique which will help you in your you know technique aspect.

29:10
Decimals 100 percentage recommended 4 of the 8 files because of course you know how to solve questions, but you have a better technique.

29:16
But does it does not mean that you cannot take all those.

29:19
You can just turn off face and still do it.

29:21
You have the complete control, but face will give you that recommendation to skip.

29:24
You can see here right Apart from that, you would have already seen the journey view where the complete prep bibit bubble quant or DI.

29:34
You would have this journey view where you would see how well you are doing compared to your peers across the global population, how well you are doing with respect to them for each other particular file.

29:45
If you're doing better than then we get a grade A.

29:46
If you're doing at par with them, we get a grade B.

29:48
And if you're doing below the bench, you get a grade C.

29:51
And for each of the grade should have a definitive set of actions to do, which your mentor would define you very clearly before you start or initiate.

29:57
So you know that is fun thing.

29:59
So it's a demand is a competitive test, right?

30:01
So it's better to keep that competitive spirit as we learn to have a clear understanding of how well we are going in terms of the plan that we are doing.

30:09
And this test that you are are you know the journey, view the greats and all these things are not based on what you have, what you had, you know what you have learned outside, its majorly based on what you have learned from our platform.

30:22
So you are being tested in those quizzes towards the end on what we teach in that particular file.

30:27
Suppose if you are teaching you on a very simple, very basic terms, if you are teaching you 3 + 5 equal to 8, they are just gonna check 5 + 7.

30:35
Are you able to get it as you know 12 That is the objective that we are going to, you know, look at and if you are getting it going to the right track and how, how fast should we calculate that just to give you a analogy.

30:47
So that that is one thing.

30:49
And the second thing is the study planner you have already seen we will be creating a study planner which should be flexible.

30:54
Suppose when you the particular day you it is, it is 2 hours that you have committed but you could do only one hour you are going to mark it as you know one hour and accordingly a calendar will exist itself or maybe you committed to us cannot study at all.

31:07
You are going to mark it as a no study day.

31:08
But let us assume that they turned out to be holiday.

31:11
You could keep say 5 hours you are going to move as 5 hours according to your calendar legs.

31:17
So you know, so as you start you would have a customised study plan and it is it is very unique for a particular study.

31:23
It is like a fingerprint because to a great extent this is a skeleton.

31:27
We would say this is skeleton, the flesh and the skin would be a mentor would be building on top of the skeleton based on what you need.

31:34
So that is the that is a, you know, custom approach that you would take towards the test.

31:38
And yeah, then we have multi stage learning since Ch 2, you would go.

31:45
And so so the data that we would be capturing here is if you just go to the skill data would find if it is CR within CR for each of the particular topics, there are 9 topics for each of the particular topics.

31:55
How is your accuracy?

31:57
How is your average correct time, incorrect time, block level analysis?

32:00
Then if it is RC, then what are the different topics that challenges you or you know troubles you?

32:05
Then if you look at you know, quants within quants properties, word problems, advanced topics is your arithmetic, you are still bifurcated.

32:13
So how well you are doing in these particular types of files and all the things and the same goes to data inside as well.

32:18
We have a dedicated DI course.

32:20
If you just see like quant and verbal, we have a dedicated DI course which should cover the whole aspect where we teach you from the fundamentals.

32:27
If you take graphic interpretation, table analysis, you would learn from the fundamentals.

32:30
So you know it is a dedicated full length course.

32:33
It is in some platforms still are following that old classic format with you know they just add a couple of files in DI as an extension to quant, not as a dedicated section which is to be considered as a dedicated section, right.

32:47
So that is why the test also has separate section for it.

32:51
So you will have a dedicated full length course for DI as Welland of course like the way I said you will have full length mocks.

32:57
We will have subsectional marks.

32:59
So you will have around 90 plus sectional marks around you know around 100 subsectional marks just for CR, just for RC this for arithmetic algebra, just for DS like data inserts all the 4 sections and you will have custom courses for targeted learning.

33:13
If if I take let us say I have all I have been showing quad.

33:17
So lets let me show you say this one.

33:21
If I take what problems we can actually or algebra, we can actually do targeted learning for that by going and just selecting the areas that we need to work on and then do a targeted learning for each of the types of questions.

33:34
Same goes for data insights as well.

33:38
You can, you can come here and do targeted learning.

33:40
So, so there is a lot that you can do with this platform and, and this is television.

33:46
You do not have to purchase anything else for your, you know, GMAT club.

33:51
So that is that is one thing to go here data sufficiency, you have these many types of questions for each type of question we can do targeted learning.

33:57
There are certain probability, there are special reasoning, there are number of properties, there are statistics or beat any of the sections you are going to have the same yeah.

34:06
So that's that's the whole aspect.

34:09
Now over to you.

34:10
If you have any questions, you know we have covered comprehensively, but still you might have some questions if so we can discuss right now.

34:18
Yes, so, so I will let me just give me the like what is the plans and pricing because I have few questions around it.

34:28
OK, you are looking for 4 months, right?

34:31
I can go for 6 months also.

34:35
OK.

34:35
So 6 months is priced at 3:00, $99 and 4 months in the platform is $299.

34:44
So 299 is around 2590399 is around 34500.

34:54
So that's the pricing and we also have live classes which I don't recommend you to purchase right away but rather if you once you get into the selfish and I will tell you what happens in the live class like any other you know platforms giving you a live class in like any of the institute that gives you a live class across the globe.

35:13
You are going to have an instructor coming in and they will be solving questions and you will be learning through solving.

35:18
That's approach that it has been there since existence for all life class across the globe.

35:22
So you are going to have the same here as well.

35:25
But you have to contribute on multiple things.

35:28
You know GMAT is a test where there are working professionals and the the live class happens only at a fixed time.

35:35
So you know if it is a recorded session then what is the purpose of taking a live class?

35:39
Live class has to be live.

35:40
So you know the timing.

35:42
Does it suit you?

35:44
Probably it will be in the evening everyday you will have sessions, you know, 5 to 6 days a week you would have sessions in the evening.

35:52
And even if you take live class, live classes not a replacement for the self base because there are certain limitations for life class where all the data that we capture which we use in the last minute push program because the fine tuning towards the later part is very important.

36:05
Because see a student can buy themselves get to a 615 score at 1:00 point of time.

36:10
Maybe with a dedicated course you would get there in say 4 months.

36:14
If not with a dedicated course, they might take one year, that is the difference.

36:17
But eventually with the free materials online, YouTube and all these things, you would eventually get to a position where in GMAT you would know how to solve all questions because the the syllabus is limited.

36:27
So the idea is to optimise.

36:29
So most students would get plateaued there and then they will be stuck because they don't have, we don't have the data to, you know, proceed further to identify what exactly has to be dealt with.

36:38
So, so life class is never a replacement of selfish but an extension if you have more time.

36:44
So what I would suggest is if you even want to try, you can take free couple of live sessions and see if it is actually helping you to a great extent.

36:53
And if you feel that OK this is something which I definitely want to go for, go for it after taking 2 of the live classes.

36:59
And also I will also show even if you take a self paced course, you are still going to have webinars.

37:04
But the catch is webinars happens every Saturday, Sunday you will find that you know 11:00 AM IST.

37:12
So webinars are in self paged also like self based also it's going to be there.

37:15
But the catches in webinars around 100 because it's not something which we charge extra, right.

37:20
So around 100, 100 to 150 students might join in, in, in a session.

37:25
So it's going to be your, all your doubts may not be cleared there.

37:29
But in the live class it will be a batch of 3 to 5.

37:31
That's the difference.

37:32
OK.

37:33
And any other differences in self paid versus live sessions like mock and everything are covered in both, right.

37:39
We, we have a student.

37:41
Yeah, yeah, everything is same.

37:42
And to to give you a context, we have a student who got a 765 in GMAT focus just with self based.

37:50
So 765 is way above that 100 percentile that 735 is 100 percentile.

37:54
So 765 is a really high score with just self placed.

37:59
Yeah.

38:00
So you know, that is enough to be precise.

38:03
And generally life class are taken by our majority of the crowd that takes live class and majorly students who are still studying and then people who have taken a sabbatical kind of you know from from work and you know, they have ample time.

38:18
So they would go for that.

38:20
So that is a major crowd.

38:22
Yeah, self phase would work for me.

38:23
But yeah, I will be going for 6 months considering I have time.

38:28
And anyway, is there any extension possible if the 6 months over and I want like a 2 months extension, See we can go for even 15 days extension or one month extension also for $49 or 115 days, 16 days $49.

38:44
You know, one week extension is $29 and say one month extension is $89.

38:52
So we have all the flexibility at that point of time.

38:54
But generally in in your case, how many hours a week in a week, how many hours are you planning to study?

39:00
Like what's your.

39:02
Yeah.

39:03
So my agenda would be like in weekdays I can study for 2 hours OK, 2 to 10 hours.

39:10
Yeah.

39:10
And then on weekends I can study for like 5 hours.

39:14
So 20 hours time.

39:16
We shouldn't be taking more than 6 months.

39:17
To be honest, you should be even if you started a score as low as 300 kind of thing, you should be able to pull it off because a journey from 300 to 500 is going to be very short because it is like an exponential curve.

39:29
Your learning is going to be that once you hit that 555 you you feel that each, each increment of point is a bit slow from that point.

39:39
So till then it is going to be pretty safe.

39:41
So some even if you start at 3:55 till 555 is just around one 1/2 months of time that extra that you take.

39:48
So basically you should be getting to last mile push program by around 44 months even if you start late.

39:56
So you know you should be up there.

39:58
