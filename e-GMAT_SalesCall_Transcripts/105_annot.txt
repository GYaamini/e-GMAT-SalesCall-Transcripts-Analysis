2:23
Hey, , , you are on mute if you are talking.
Speaker: unknown

2:32
Hello.
Speaker: unknown

2:33
Yeah, hi.
Speaker: unknown

2:34
Hello.
Speaker: unknown

2:35
Yeah, .
Speaker: unknown

2:36
So, yeah, so we had a fair level first, you know, first level discussion in WhatsApp where you said you just starting your prep and want to take in the month of July.
Speaker: agent

2:47
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

2:48
So, so a couple of things I would like to ask is you are currently working Apna?
Speaker: agent

2:53
Yeah, I am currently working.
Speaker: prospect

2:54
I have an experience of around 6 years.
Speaker: prospect

2:58
OK, OK, that's good.
Speaker: agent

2:59
that's good.
Speaker: agent

3:00
And so, so I just want to understand you are looking for the round one application if I am not round one application for this year, right?
Speaker: agent

3:11
Yeah, round one application.
Speaker: prospect

3:12
what's your target schools?
Speaker: agent

3:14
My target schools are ISPI am also exploring the IIM.
Speaker: prospect

3:20
I am BGP, PGPX and also NCI at Singapore.
Speaker: prospect

3:26
OK, so majorly India is specific and then yeah, NCR is one option for you.
Speaker: agent

3:32
Mostly I am going towards India.
Speaker: prospect

3:35
OK, understood.
Speaker: agent

3:37
So even even say ISV offers up to 100% scholarship and wrong applications for the great team as go.
Speaker: agent

3:44
So you know, you have that, you know, right now at least you're not in the month of say April of May, You are at least the month of February so that you would have Apple Railway to actually, you know, prepare and get it started.
Speaker: agent

3:58
So before this, have you taken any test or no, just coming out of group.
Speaker: agent

4:04
I haven't taken any test.
Speaker: prospect

4:06
I gave cat when I was in college like back in 2018 and gotten percentile of 77 if I remember.
Speaker: prospect

4:16
OK alright so so in this call I assume that you updated Naive 2 even you know you have done a basic research about eating right?
Speaker: agent

4:27
But still I would like to give you an overview.
Speaker: agent

4:30
So, you know, before I give a complete understanding, I, I would be sharing you 2 short videos, very short videos which you have to watch to understand at a surface level in a very concentrated way that because it is in a very short video comprising of a lot of things.
Speaker: agent

4:49
And when I after that you would have some questions invoked in you.
Speaker: agent

4:53
And when I explain you things, then it will be a bit more clearer rather than I am just maybe just directly started.
Speaker: agent

4:59
So I will send you that right now in that in the chat box, just, you know, check that out.
Speaker: agent

5:08
I am just mentioning as video one and video 2 for that order.
Speaker: agent

5:14
So I have send a video one.
Speaker: agent

5:17
The video one is regarding the course overview and video 2 is regarding the mental support.
Speaker: agent

5:22
We have a dedicated mental support for our program.
Speaker: agent

5:25
So how how does this work?
Speaker: agent

5:27
You would have some questions once you finish it, but of course I am there to you know, help you with that.
Speaker: agent

5:31
So yeah.
Speaker: agent

5:33
So these are the 2 videos which you can watch right now.
Speaker: agent

5:38
We will be on mute.
Speaker: agent

5:38
I will be waiting for you.
Speaker: agent

5:40
So once you are done just unmute and say hi.
Speaker: agent

5:42
I will.
Speaker: prospect

5:43
I will.
Speaker: prospect

5:43
We will discuss at that point.
Speaker: agent

5:46
OK, Yeah, I will watch and I will let you know.
Speaker: prospect

5:50
Sure, sure.
Speaker: agent

5:50
I will be here.
Speaker: agent

5:51
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

19:41
Hi, Amrit.
Speaker: unknown

19:46
Hello.
Speaker: unknown

19:47
Yeah, Yeah, I went to these videos.
Speaker: prospect

19:50
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

19:51
So I hope that would have given you a fair understanding of how we are going to approach the GMAT as a whole.
Speaker: agent

19:57
And yeah.
Speaker: agent

19:58
So what do you feel?
Speaker: agent

19:59
So you know, what is it that you have got from the video, Kavina?
Speaker: agent

20:04
Yeah, I understood like the complete walkthrough of what things are there, How?
Speaker: prospect

20:09
Right.
Speaker: prospect

20:10
I can have a look at the videos, classes, the Marks and how the mentor will help me and give me the like the agenda, right?
Speaker: prospect

20:18
Both of the things I need to focus on.
Speaker: prospect

20:21
Correct, correct.
Speaker: agent

20:22
And also as you progress your journey, you are going to leave a trail of data footprints which is being utilised for, you know for for your last leg of your breath.
Speaker: agent

20:33
Yeah, that is see the mentorship program you have already seen in that video you know majorly through emails and chats and that is only till phase one.
Speaker: agent

20:42
So the complete mentorship for the complete prep is divided to 2 phases.
Speaker: agent

20:46
Phase one is still you reach a particular level of around 8080 to 80 percentile, around 6.5625 is when you would have phase one and then Phase 2.
Speaker: agent

20:56
So what happens in phase one is once you hit that particular 80 to 85 percentile, what as an output, what what can we expect is you would by then know how to solve all questions because GMAT unlike CAT or other tests where you know you have to have the very depth of understanding.
Speaker: agent

21:12
Here the depth is from the focus.
Speaker: agent

21:13
Here the technique is the focus because the depth is very shallow, right.
Speaker: agent

21:16
There are very limited types of questions that can ever come in your GMAT.
Speaker: agent

21:20
And once you identify those types and you know work on it, there is nothing new that you are going to see for your first time in your test.
Speaker: agent

21:27
But all that matters is having that high optimised efficiency.
Speaker: agent

21:31
So the first objective ways to make sure that you know how to solve all questions may be not.
Speaker: agent

21:36
If not, see the average time that you would require or you would get for solving questions in G matrix around 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

21:43
For verbal, you have 23 questions for 45 minutes, just about 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

21:47
Quants 21 minutes, you know just below 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

21:50
And for quants 21 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

21:54
And data insights, again 20 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

21:58
So on an average if you just see it is all you know close to 2 minutes of time is what you would have for your test the reason of your question.
Speaker: agent

22:06
So even if you take 33 and a half minutes on an average or 3 minutes on an average, its OK if you are getting the right answer in the phase one.
Speaker: agent

22:14
So that is the objective.
Speaker: agent

22:15
There are 64 questions, at least 63 to 64 questions or at least in the worst case 62 questions you should be able to solve in that you know relax time environment and till then you would have your mental support majorly via you know.
Speaker: agent

22:30
I will share my screen also for for you to have an understanding if I if I take say a critical tracing or any of the sections.
Speaker: agent

22:39
Yeah, this is the chat window.
Speaker: agent

22:41
You know that that they are going to have where you know whenever you ping your mentor, you are going to get a pop up.
Speaker: agent

22:47
They are going to get a pop up and they ping you.
Speaker: agent

22:48
You are going to get a pop up and whenever it is not just in chat, you are also going to get a mail of it.
Speaker: agent

22:54
So you know you are going to get the communication recorded in your mail by default.
Speaker: agent

22:59
So that is going to be there and you know chat does not necessarily mean typing.
Speaker: agent

23:03
It could be the loop videos which which you know you have just watched our loop videos.
Speaker: agent

23:07
So it would not take much time for your mentor to create a short loop video to explain you rather than just typing and creating a confusion.
Speaker: agent

23:14
So you know, generally we prefer that and if it is something pretty straightforward, we will just type and send it to you as well.
Speaker: agent

23:20
So that is how it is going to be in phase one and once you enter Phase 2 that is once you reach a capability to solve all questions that comes in front of you, you require a dedicated you know, you know structure or a strategy to now get all the questions in under less than 2 minutes.
Speaker: agent

23:39
And how does it happen?
Speaker: agent

23:40
It happens through our flagship program called the Last Mile Push.
Speaker: agent

23:43
So you know when we say it is a program, it is a different program.
Speaker: agent

23:46
You know don't get into the things that it is going to be additional charge.
Speaker: agent

23:50
It is inclusive within the course because what we believe is nobody enrolls in a course for you know, getting a 615 rates everyone gets in a course, you know gets gets a course for getting a high score.
Speaker: agent

24:01
So we don't charge anything extra for it.
Speaker: agent

24:04
But the idea is once you start or you know, the idea is the first objective that you need to get is to hit that particular personnel to be eligible for this.
Speaker: agent

24:16
And all all the students that you would see if you have follow, if you have been following us on YouTube, you would have seen that we are actually having the highest number of success rate compared to almost the top global platforms you went towards from the second test.
Speaker: agent

24:30
And, and everybody that you would see in our YouTube channel.
Speaker: agent

24:33
I will I will just quickly show you as well that you know, the you know, they have gone through the last minute push program where you would have one on one session with your mentors.
Speaker: agent

24:41
Beyond that, once you are once you enter the last minute push program, it will not be chat or meal, but it will be one on one session that you would have a with your mentor where the complete agenda is for fine tuning and time management.
Speaker: agent

24:52
That will be the only focus in the last minute push program.
Speaker: agent

24:55
So, so some students directly enrolled for last week which program also who already have given their actual test.
Speaker: agent

25:02
And this is one of the students who got a 625 in an actual test and you know, joined us.
Speaker: agent

25:09
She gave, she had she was running on deadline, had only around 17 days and had another test.
Speaker: agent

25:15
She joined us for 15 days and and got to a 695 score.
Speaker: agent

25:21
So, you know, we have a lot of scenarios and we have students who get 725 just you just need to do only one thing.
Speaker: agent

25:28
If you are looking for a 700 plus, see just to give you a context, you know the median of the median score for ISB is 655.
Speaker: agent

25:35
For I, I, Ms is also around 655.
Speaker: agent

25:38
And for NCR the median score is around 675685.
Speaker: agent

25:42
You need to score, you need to plan at least 2030 points on top of the median score to get an interview call.
Speaker: agent

25:49
And for ISB, if you are targeting a 715 or like A908909 percentile, you can get up to 100% scholarships also.
Speaker: agent

25:56
So that should be a focus provided the time frame that you have got right.
Speaker: agent

26:01
So we have a lot of such examples.
Speaker: agent

26:03
We would find a lot of students who are getting A908909 percentile on a monthly basis.
Speaker: agent

26:08
You would find plenty.
Speaker: agent

26:10
So you know that is one thing.
Speaker: agent

26:11
And regarding GMAT Club, which is the world's largest community of all the GMAT aspirin sectors of globe, you would find, you know, we having the highest number of reviews, verified reviews for getting posted 2.8 K.
Speaker: agent

26:26
The second best is TDP.
Speaker: agent

26:27
You would find it is almost half.
Speaker: agent

26:30
And then you would find the average rating is 4.7 out of 5.
Speaker: agent

26:33
And almost everyone would be talking about how the last mail push program has been helpful and how the journey has been helpful throughout their prep and all these things.
Speaker: agent

26:42
So just you also give you a context.
Speaker: agent

26:44
I would like to show you one of the students, you know, who came back to prep after a really long time.
Speaker: agent

26:54
So let me just open it up to somewhere here.
Speaker: agent

26:59
So he came back after 20 years of work eggs.
Speaker: agent

27:03
You know, when when someone comes back after 20 years of work eggs, you know, you would pretty much be, you know, you pretty much understand that, you know, they, they are practically starting from that Ground Zero.
Speaker: agent

27:14
So this is one of the students who came back to prep after, you know, around 19 years of work case after 20 years that he came back to academics and got to a score of 685.
Speaker: agent

27:27
And there are other examples as well who have done that, who has done that in their journey.
Speaker: agent

27:32
So, so most people will talk about how the Olympic program has been successful where, you know, like the way I said, no extra cost provided you are already at a good level that is around 80th percentile level.
Speaker: agent

27:42
So to boost a peer score and this is also another student who came after 20 years of work eggs, you know, so when these people can do anybody can do that, that is the idea.
Speaker: agent

27:55
So you know, when someone gets 20 plus years of experience can come in and you know, crack it and get A6856959798 percentile, you know, we we can do because it is it is a standard process that has to follow.
Speaker: agent

28:09
We cover from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

28:10
But of course, even if you look at quants, let us assume that if it is quants, maybe there is a fact that you know, you may not know.
Speaker: agent

28:19
Say let us assume that 60% of things, so 70% of the things you do not know, at least 3030% of the things you might remember it, you might know.
Speaker: agent

28:25
So what we have in the quantity is something called personalised adaptive course engine, we call it PACE.
Speaker: agent

28:30
What it does is within each of the modules, you would have a diagnostic quiz.
Speaker: agent

28:34
Based on how you perform in the diagnostic quiz, we capture multiple data, your average correct time, incorrect time, accuracy, time pressure management, all these things and then recommend you to take only those particular files where you are going to have a definitive learning.
Speaker: agent

28:47
And we are going to recommend you to skip the files which you have already mastered or you are already a master it.
Speaker: agent

28:53
So by that way you are not spending.
Speaker: agent

28:55
Suppose here you got 100 percentage recommended none here you got 100 percentage but still recommended to the files because maybe you know how to solve the question.
Speaker: agent

29:03
But if you attend these 2 files, you are going to have a better technique which will help you in your you know technique aspect.
Speaker: agent

29:10
Decimals 100 percentage recommended 4 of the 8 files because of course you know how to solve questions, but you have a better technique.
Speaker: agent

29:16
But does it does not mean that you cannot take all those.
Speaker: agent

29:19
You can just turn off face and still do it.
Speaker: agent

29:21
You have the complete control, but face will give you that recommendation to skip.
Speaker: agent

29:24
You can see here right Apart from that, you would have already seen the journey view where the complete prep bibit bubble quant or DI.
Speaker: agent

29:34
You would have this journey view where you would see how well you are doing compared to your peers across the global population, how well you are doing with respect to them for each other particular file.
Speaker: agent

29:45
If you're doing better than then we get a grade A.
Speaker: agent

29:46
If you're doing at par with them, we get a grade B.
Speaker: agent

29:48
And if you're doing below the bench, you get a grade C.
Speaker: agent

29:51
And for each of the grade should have a definitive set of actions to do, which your mentor would define you very clearly before you start or initiate.
Speaker: agent

29:57
So you know that is fun thing.
Speaker: agent

29:59
So it's a demand is a competitive test, right?
Speaker: agent

30:01
So it's better to keep that competitive spirit as we learn to have a clear understanding of how well we are going in terms of the plan that we are doing.
Speaker: agent

30:09
And this test that you are are you know the journey, view the greats and all these things are not based on what you have, what you had, you know what you have learned outside, its majorly based on what you have learned from our platform.
Speaker: agent

30:22
So you are being tested in those quizzes towards the end on what we teach in that particular file.
Speaker: agent

30:27
Suppose if you are teaching you on a very simple, very basic terms, if you are teaching you 3 + 5 equal to 8, they are just gonna check 5 + 7.
Speaker: agent

30:35
Are you able to get it as you know 12 That is the objective that we are going to, you know, look at and if you are getting it going to the right track and how, how fast should we calculate that just to give you a analogy.
Speaker: agent

30:47
So that that is one thing.
Speaker: agent

30:49
And the second thing is the study planner you have already seen we will be creating a study planner which should be flexible.
Speaker: agent

30:54
Suppose when you the particular day you it is, it is 2 hours that you have committed but you could do only one hour you are going to mark it as you know one hour and accordingly a calendar will exist itself or maybe you committed to us cannot study at all.
Speaker: agent

31:07
You are going to mark it as a no study day.
Speaker: agent

31:08
But let us assume that they turned out to be holiday.
Speaker: agent

31:11
You could keep say 5 hours you are going to move as 5 hours according to your calendar legs.
Speaker: agent

31:17
So you know, so as you start you would have a customised study plan and it is it is very unique for a particular study.
Speaker: agent

31:23
It is like a fingerprint because to a great extent this is a skeleton.
Speaker: agent

31:27
We would say this is skeleton, the flesh and the skin would be a mentor would be building on top of the skeleton based on what you need.
Speaker: agent

31:34
So that is the that is a, you know, custom approach that you would take towards the test.
Speaker: agent

31:38
And yeah, then we have multi stage learning since Ch 2, you would go.
Speaker: agent

31:45
And so so the data that we would be capturing here is if you just go to the skill data would find if it is CR within CR for each of the particular topics, there are 9 topics for each of the particular topics.
Speaker: agent

31:55
How is your accuracy?
Speaker: agent

31:57
How is your average correct time, incorrect time, block level analysis?
Speaker: agent

32:00
Then if it is RC, then what are the different topics that challenges you or you know troubles you?
Speaker: agent

32:05
Then if you look at you know, quants within quants properties, word problems, advanced topics is your arithmetic, you are still bifurcated.
Speaker: agent

32:13
So how well you are doing in these particular types of files and all the things and the same goes to data inside as well.
Speaker: agent

32:18
We have a dedicated DI course.
Speaker: agent

32:20
If you just see like quant and verbal, we have a dedicated DI course which should cover the whole aspect where we teach you from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

32:27
If you take graphic interpretation, table analysis, you would learn from the fundamentals.
Speaker: agent

32:30
So you know it is a dedicated full length course.
Speaker: agent

32:33
It is in some platforms still are following that old classic format with you know they just add a couple of files in DI as an extension to quant, not as a dedicated section which is to be considered as a dedicated section, right.
Speaker: agent

32:47
So that is why the test also has separate section for it.
Speaker: agent

32:51
So you will have a dedicated full length course for DI as Welland of course like the way I said you will have full length mocks.
Speaker: agent

32:57
We will have subsectional marks.
Speaker: agent

32:59
So you will have around 90 plus sectional marks around you know around 100 subsectional marks just for CR, just for RC this for arithmetic algebra, just for DS like data inserts all the 4 sections and you will have custom courses for targeted learning.
Speaker: agent

33:13
If if I take let us say I have all I have been showing quad.
Speaker: agent

33:17
So lets let me show you say this one.
Speaker: agent

33:21
If I take what problems we can actually or algebra, we can actually do targeted learning for that by going and just selecting the areas that we need to work on and then do a targeted learning for each of the types of questions.
Speaker: agent

33:34
Same goes for data insights as well.
Speaker: agent

33:38
You can, you can come here and do targeted learning.
Speaker: agent

33:40
So, so there is a lot that you can do with this platform and, and this is television.
Speaker: agent

33:46
You do not have to purchase anything else for your, you know, GMAT club.
Speaker: agent

33:51
So that is that is one thing to go here data sufficiency, you have these many types of questions for each type of question we can do targeted learning.
Speaker: agent

33:57
There are certain probability, there are special reasoning, there are number of properties, there are statistics or beat any of the sections you are going to have the same yeah.
Speaker: agent

34:06
So that's that's the whole aspect.
Speaker: agent

34:09
Now over to you.
Speaker: agent

34:10
If you have any questions, you know we have covered comprehensively, but still you might have some questions if so we can discuss right now.
Speaker: agent

34:18
Yes, so, so I will let me just give me the like what is the plans and pricing because I have few questions around it.
Speaker: prospect

34:28
OK, you are looking for 4 months, right?
Speaker: agent

34:31
I can go for 6 months also.
Speaker: prospect

34:35
OK.
Speaker: agent

34:35
So 6 months is priced at 3:00, $99 and 4 months in the platform is $299.
Speaker: agent

34:44
So 299 is around 2590399 is around 34500.
Speaker: agent

34:54
So that's the pricing and we also have live classes which I don't recommend you to purchase right away but rather if you once you get into the selfish and I will tell you what happens in the live class like any other you know platforms giving you a live class in like any of the institute that gives you a live class across the globe.
Speaker: agent

35:13
You are going to have an instructor coming in and they will be solving questions and you will be learning through solving.
Speaker: agent

35:18
That's approach that it has been there since existence for all life class across the globe.
Speaker: agent

35:22
So you are going to have the same here as well.
Speaker: agent

35:25
But you have to contribute on multiple things.
Speaker: agent

35:28
You know GMAT is a test where there are working professionals and the the live class happens only at a fixed time.
Speaker: agent

35:35
So you know if it is a recorded session then what is the purpose of taking a live class?
Speaker: agent

35:39
Live class has to be live.
Speaker: agent

35:40
So you know the timing.
Speaker: agent

35:42
Does it suit you?
Speaker: agent

35:44
Probably it will be in the evening everyday you will have sessions, you know, 5 to 6 days a week you would have sessions in the evening.
Speaker: agent

35:52
And even if you take live class, live classes not a replacement for the self base because there are certain limitations for life class where all the data that we capture which we use in the last minute push program because the fine tuning towards the later part is very important.
Speaker: agent

36:05
Because see a student can buy themselves get to a 615 score at 1:00 point of time.
Speaker: agent

36:10
Maybe with a dedicated course you would get there in say 4 months.
Speaker: agent

36:14
If not with a dedicated course, they might take one year, that is the difference.
Speaker: agent

36:17
But eventually with the free materials online, YouTube and all these things, you would eventually get to a position where in GMAT you would know how to solve all questions because the the syllabus is limited.
Speaker: agent

36:27
So the idea is to optimise.
Speaker: agent

36:29
So most students would get plateaued there and then they will be stuck because they don't have, we don't have the data to, you know, proceed further to identify what exactly has to be dealt with.
Speaker: agent

36:38
So, so life class is never a replacement of selfish but an extension if you have more time.
Speaker: agent

36:44
So what I would suggest is if you even want to try, you can take free couple of live sessions and see if it is actually helping you to a great extent.
Speaker: agent

36:53
And if you feel that OK this is something which I definitely want to go for, go for it after taking 2 of the live classes.
Speaker: agent

36:59
And also I will also show even if you take a self paced course, you are still going to have webinars.
Speaker: agent

37:04
But the catch is webinars happens every Saturday, Sunday you will find that you know 11:00 AM IST.
Speaker: agent

37:12
So webinars are in self paged also like self based also it's going to be there.
Speaker: agent

37:15
But the catches in webinars around 100 because it's not something which we charge extra, right.
Speaker: agent

37:20
So around 100, 100 to 150 students might join in, in, in a session.
Speaker: agent

37:25
So it's going to be your, all your doubts may not be cleared there.
Speaker: agent

37:29
But in the live class it will be a batch of 3 to 5.
Speaker: agent

37:31
That's the difference.
Speaker: agent

37:32
OK.
Speaker: prospect

37:33
And any other differences in self paid versus live sessions like mock and everything are covered in both, right.
Speaker: prospect

37:39
We, we have a student.
Speaker: agent

37:41
Yeah, yeah, everything is same.
Speaker: agent

37:42
And to to give you a context, we have a student who got a 765 in GMAT focus just with self based.
Speaker: agent

37:50
So 765 is way above that 100 percentile that 735 is 100 percentile.
Speaker: agent

37:54
So 765 is a really high score with just self placed.
Speaker: agent

37:59
Yeah.
Speaker: agent

38:00
So you know, that is enough to be precise.
Speaker: agent

38:03
And generally life class are taken by our majority of the crowd that takes live class and majorly students who are still studying and then people who have taken a sabbatical kind of you know from from work and you know, they have ample time.
Speaker: agent

38:18
So they would go for that.
Speaker: agent

38:20
So that is a major crowd.
Speaker: agent

38:22
Yeah, self phase would work for me.
Speaker: prospect

38:23
But yeah, I will be going for 6 months considering I have time.
Speaker: prospect

38:28
And anyway, is there any extension possible if the 6 months over and I want like a 2 months extension, See we can go for even 15 days extension or one month extension also for $49 or 115 days, 16 days $49.
Speaker: agent

38:44
You know, one week extension is $29 and say one month extension is $89.
Speaker: agent

38:52
So we have all the flexibility at that point of time.
Speaker: agent

38:54
But generally in in your case, how many hours a week in a week, how many hours are you planning to study?
Speaker: agent

39:00
Like what's your.
Speaker: agent

39:02
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

39:03
So my agenda would be like in weekdays I can study for 2 hours OK, 2 to 10 hours.
Speaker: prospect

39:10
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

39:10
And then on weekends I can study for like 5 hours.
Speaker: prospect

39:14
So 20 hours time.
Speaker: prospect

39:16
We shouldn't be taking more than 6 months.
Speaker: agent

39:17
To be honest, you should be even if you started a score as low as 300 kind of thing, you should be able to pull it off because a journey from 300 to 500 is going to be very short because it is like an exponential curve.
Speaker: agent

39:29
Your learning is going to be that once you hit that 555 you you feel that each, each increment of point is a bit slow from that point.
Speaker: agent

39:39
So till then it is going to be pretty safe.
Speaker: agent

39:41
So some even if you start at 3:55 till 555 is just around one 1/2 months of time that extra that you take.
Speaker: agent

39:48
So basically you should be getting to last mile push program by around 44 months even if you start late.
Speaker: agent

39:56
So you know you should be up there.
Speaker: agent

39:58
So should not be taking more than with with the schedule that you have set consistently we are giving in say 20 hours without fail every week.
Speaker: agent

40:05
Should not be taking more than 6 months.
Speaker: agent

40:07
It should be done with it in 5 to end of months for sure.
Speaker: agent

40:11
Got it.
Speaker: prospect

40:12
Yeah and then there's no like book hard copy and books and all required.
Speaker: prospect

40:17
Everything would be like online.
Speaker: prospect

40:18
No, everything is online and you know yeah.
Speaker: agent

40:22
Do we have online some notes or those kind of also things available on the portal or it's just like the questions and the explanations around that?
Speaker: prospect

40:31
See regarding the notes as every time you finish it, you are going to get a summary which is downloadable.
Speaker: agent

40:37
So you know you can you can you can download that as a short notes.
Speaker: agent

40:42
And we generally recommend you to take create a small so you get some instructions as well as you progress where each of the particular file you have something new you learn.
Speaker: agent

40:52
You just have to take a note of that just to use it as a slash slash kind of things.
Speaker: agent

40:57
So you will be given instruction on that.
Speaker: agent

40:59
So that is not a trouble.
Speaker: agent

41:03
Yeah, I think I am good then.
Speaker: prospect

41:05
And then the study plan things.
Speaker: prospect

41:07
Will you be sharing right now or it is like once I enroll for the class?
Speaker: prospect

41:10
Once you once you enroll, the first thing that you would be asked to is take the first Sigma X mock.
Speaker: agent

41:16
Once you enroll, the first thing that you would be asked to do is you will have to take a full length test through us which will be considered as a diagnostic test.
Speaker: agent

41:24
And based on which you would be building your profile even if it is low or high does not matter.
Speaker: agent

41:29
We are going to create a profile based out of the mock.
Speaker: agent

41:32
So give 2 and half hours.
Speaker: agent

41:35
So make sure that you are not doing something in between doing parallel works.
Speaker: agent

41:39
Make sure that you are in the in the right.
Speaker: agent

41:41
Say suppose if you are Saturday, Sunday, if you are available today, if you are taking it today, make sure that till 2 and half hours nobody is disturbing you.
Speaker: agent

41:48
You are finishing it and then then it is done for the day.
Speaker: agent

41:51
So you can look into it.
Speaker: agent

41:53
So when I plan to start, I am planning to start from like probably next week onwards because I am a bit occupied this weekend.
Speaker: prospect

42:03
OK.
Speaker: agent

42:04
And any like discount, anything possible for the course.
Speaker: prospect

42:09
See, once you decide, let me know.
Speaker: agent

42:12
So at that point of time, if any discounts runs or something can be given, we, we can work on it.
Speaker: agent

42:18
So whenever you decide that hey, I am, I am planning to start say tomorrow, just give me a call one day prior or give me a message one day prior.
Speaker: agent

42:26

42:35
Alright.
Speaker: agent

42:35
So keep me posted, just give me a message on Friday.
Speaker: agent

42:38
I will.
Speaker: prospect

42:39
Maybe we can get on a short WhatsApp call or normal call for a couple of minutes to discuss the pricing if anything further can be done.
Speaker: agent

42:47
Yeah, we can discuss on that.
Speaker: prospect

42:48
Yeah.
Speaker: prospect

42:49
And one last thing.
Speaker: prospect

42:51
So is there any like the group or like WhatsApp to my Telegram group with your form of all the students where we can discuss the doubts?
Speaker: prospect

42:57
Or if I have any doubts, is there any email I can drop like kind of a doubt solving?
Speaker: prospect

43:02
You can simply see if any particular doubt is there.
Speaker: agent

43:05
You have a forum within the, each of the questions would have a separate forum for you to put a doubt.
Speaker: agent

43:11
But that is what the second is.
Speaker: agent

43:13
If if your doubt is not getting cleared, you can reach out to your vendor to help you.
Speaker: agent

43:17
So you have seen in the video in itself right?
Speaker: agent

43:19
So your expert can create a short video and send it to you to explain explaining you that particular doubt.
Speaker: agent

43:25
So we have this forum within each of the questions where you can actually get it resolved option based itself.
Speaker: agent

43:30
Yeah.
