0:02
In organization for 4 1/2 years now and before that I did, we did.

0:08
And for GMAT prep, I've been like, I'm practicing online some of the quantitative questions, critical reasoning.

0:17
Yeah.

0:18
OK.

0:19
So when you say practicing online, what are your resources right now?

0:22
I'm work.

0:24
I'm practicing from gmatclub.com.

0:26
OK, got it.

0:28
And we are a few more resources here and there.

0:31
Got it.

0:32
But GMAT club is your main resource as of now, correct?

0:36
Got it.

0:37
And how long have you been preparing so far?

0:41
Couple of months, couple of months.

0:43
OK.

0:44
Have you taken any full length mock test?

0:46
Not yet, but I'm planning to do it in coming week, correct, Yes, because you've been preparing for a couple of months.

0:53
Very important to get a baseline of where you stand right now, correct?

0:57
So that will allow us to know what are your strengths and areas of improvement and what are the areas we need to target.

1:03
So that is there, what's the plan?

1:05
When are you looking to give the exam this March or April, March or April?

1:12
So, so you're looking to apply in round one this year, correct?

1:15
Correct.

1:16
Got it.

1:16
And which business schools are you aiming at Pounds, Cambridge Offshore and AUM.

1:27
Got it.

1:28
Makes sense.

1:29
Perfect.

1:30
So March or April.

1:31
So that gives us basically around two to three months in your prep right now.

1:36
Further correct, Correct.

1:38
Got it.

1:38
And how many hours are you planning on devoting every day in your prep?

1:43
I'm like, I'm working right now.

1:45
So weekends I do give 4:00 to 5:00 hours, but on weekdays it's always not possible.

1:54
But I try to give one 1-2 hours, one to two hours.

1:59
Got it.

2:00
OK, makes sense.

2:01
So right.

2:02
So this is there.

2:04
How did you find us?

2:05
How did you come across EG Mat?

2:08
When I was looking with the resources, I came across EG Mat also.

2:12
But at the time everything is paid.

2:14
So I shifted to G Mat club.

2:16
There are some few practice questions and then one of my like mother's friend's child is also like in this.

2:25
They have I qualified and they are right now studying in Cambridge.

2:29
So they also referred me EG mad got it.

2:33
OK, makes sense.

2:35
So what are the questions you have for me about your private about the platform?

2:39
First thing is like, should I go for GMAT Full example GMAT Focus?

2:45
OK, because I got to know that GMAT Focus is a better route.

2:50
So I was preparing for GMAT Focus.

2:51
Only for now GMAT the Classic is no longer an option.

2:55
And actually it has no longer been been an option since 31st January 2024.

3:01
It it has completely been replaced by GMAT Focus Edition.

3:04
So almost for an entire year now it's only GMAT Focus Edition.

3:08
OK, So I guess I'm on right track then in GMAT Focus.

3:13
So there is range, right?

3:15
So the colleges I'm trying to target what, what par score I do need, correct.

3:22
Like below that, there is no chance.

3:25
That is what I'm concerned.

3:27
Got it, got it.

3:28
So typically the Business School that you mentioned, the median score is going to be close to six, 75685.

3:33
Typically that's a median score.

3:35
Always a good idea to aim at least 2030 points higher.

3:38
So the score that you've targeted, 705 is basically a good score to aim at these business schools.

3:44
In fact, I would say make it, make your target to be something close to 7:15.

3:48
That's a 99 percentile.

3:50
Now, of course, that's a decent score to be aiming at the Business School that you mentioned.

3:55
Apart from that, other factors of your profile like your business, sorry, your work experience, your leadership experience, extracurriculars, academics, all of those matter as well.

4:06
So when you decide on the right GMAT score, you need to decide on the fact that what do you want that GMAT score to do for you.

4:14
For example, if you have a strong profile, you can arrange strong letters of recommendation, then you're safe enough targeting even the median score, something like a 685.

4:22
If there are parts of your profile which you feel need to be offset with other with a good GMAT score, then you need to be aiming 2030 points higher around that.

4:31
I, I'm like letter of recommendation would be from the organization, right?

4:35
Not from the college which it's 4.5 years since I left college, right?

4:41
Typically again from your immediate supervisor.

4:43
That would be the ideal thing.

4:45
The immediate supervisor I can arrange a good letter of recommendation and how many letter of recommendations are required.

4:53
Again, that that is something we need to look at every business school's requirements.

4:58
So that may vary from one Business School to Business School in, in in terms of other parts of your profile.

5:04
If if you need help with profile evaluation, better thing it would be to get in touch with a good admissions consultant so that they can, because we're at the prep side of things, so they can verify your evaluate your profile and then recommend which courses, which programs would suit your profile.

5:20
I did that.

5:20
I did recommend to, I'm, I mean, I did consult two or three bill consultants and what I, what I finalize things on that first I need a GMAT score and then I need to, and like almost all of them told me that you have a decent profile, but the first thing is you need to get this GMAT score out of the way.

5:45
So they, they didn't like force me on any particular score, but but yeah, they, they told me that first get the GMAT out of the way.

5:55
Then we can plan the applications to which school and everything.

6:00
But yeah, they do did tell me that that the profile is a decent profile because I do have exposure also.

6:07
And back in the college days, I used to do some event organizations as well.

6:11
I was part of extracurricular activities as well.

6:14
So yeah, yeah.

6:15
And academic wise is also decent enough.

6:19
Got it.

6:20
So yeah.

6:20
So you have that cover?

6:21
Exactly.

6:22
I mean, that's typically what was admission consultancy anyway, because Dmart is your first step.

6:26
Once you have that score out of the way, then the rest of the process starts making sense that you can peacefully devote good two to three months to work on your application.

6:33
And you know, you should you join an Envision consultant, you also want to give them sufficient time as well to work with you on your application essays and all.

6:40
So that is there.

6:42
And plus the good ones are booked by me.

6:44
So the timeline that you have, March and April is actually required for you because then the consultants that remain after me, they're generally not that good.

6:53
So, so, so March, April timeline is pretty important for round one.

6:58
So do do you recommend any of the consultants?

7:00
Like do I, I'll give you website links after our call.

7:04
I'll share the website links of the recommended division consultants.

7:06
You can contact them, try and have an initial conversation if needed, but I'll I'll share those links with you.

7:13
OK.

7:14
And one more thing like do you give a mock test before joining so that I can evaluate like do I need to hello, your voice sort of broke off you're back now.

7:23
Yeah, please go ahead.

7:25
Yeah, I was asking that do you provide a mock test?

7:29
So before joining and before like actually moving into the finances thing, I do get to know like where I stand so that do I need self practice still more or can I go with the exam?

7:41
Because anyways, like I discussed with you, I'll be able to take only one or two months program, not more than that.

7:48
It's quite expensive as well.

7:50
So like I want to go in with like half, more than half prepared and like only defining things and to target the score and I want to achieve.

8:03
Got it.

8:04
So we do have a free mock test.

8:05
We have a free trial course.

8:06
Have you joined that free trial course?

8:09
No, not yet.

8:09
My EG matter.

8:11
I haven't tried anything.

8:12
I just contacted just now like in two weeks back.

8:15
Got it.

8:16
So there's a free trial course.

8:18
I they share the direct link to the free trial course.

8:20
It has 25 free video lessons across verbal content DA.

8:25
Typically these are interactive video lessons.

8:26
A file takes about 30 minutes of your time.

8:28
After every concept, there's a short course that gives you an understanding of how well you've learned the concept.

8:33
So you have those as part of your free trial.

8:36
Free trial is like 5% of the full course.

8:38
You have one free full length adaptive mock test called the Sigma X mock which will give you complete analysis just like the official D Sorry, sorry, sorry to cut you off.

8:47
Your voice broke.

8:49
Got it.

8:49
So what I was saying was free trial has 25 plus free video lessons and apart from that you have one free mock test available.

8:57
It's a full length adaptive test called the Sigma X mock.

8:59
It will give you the analysis just like the official GMAT.

9:03
OK, So you can take that as part of your free trial course.

9:07
So in fact, let me show you how that mock would look like, how the interface would look like.

9:13
One SEC, sure.

9:15
And one more request, can I also get the recording of the session?

9:20
I will do that, of course, certainly.

9:23
Sure.

9:23
Let me share my screen.

9:43
Yes.

9:43
Can you see my screen?

9:45
Yeah, perfect.

9:46
Now this is what your first mock test will look like.

9:50
I mean, of course, overall has five full length tests.

9:52
First one is available in your free trial course.

9:54
It will take 2.5 hours of your time, so you need to reserve the time, you know, and take it when you're at your best.

9:59
You're not exhausted after the end of a, you know, long day's work because we wanted to be a good indicator of your ability.

10:07
Now, once you take this mock, you'll get a clear breakdown.

10:09
What is your verbal ability, Converb ability, DI ability, and you will also get the further breakdown.

10:15
So for example, within verbal, where, where are you stronger?

10:19
Do are you strong in critical reasoning or are you stronger reading compression?

10:22
You get this, these data points and you'll get the complete question wise attempt.

10:27
You have this time management chart where you can see for different question, what is the time you took?

10:32
What is the median time?

10:33
What was the difficulty level of the questions?

10:35
You can see the topics you got right or wrong with timing info as well as detailed solutions to each and every question that you attempt here.

10:41
So essentially 2.5 hours, you'll get a complete picture of where you spend, where you stand right now.

10:48
OK, So the first level, yeah, go ahead.

10:51
In GMAT there is only these three sections, right?

10:54
Critical reasoning in relation then quantitative, right, Verbal, quant and data insights, Yes, yeah, verbal, quant and data.

11:02
So data insights, is that critical reasoning part only, right?

11:05
No, no, no, no, no.

11:06
Verbal has two subsections.

11:09
In fact, let me share the whiteboard.

11:12
We will discuss by actually by critical reasoning.

11:14
What I'm trying to refer is that 2 statements are given and according to those statements, you can decide that if first statement is enough to answer second statement, data sufficiency, which is a part of data insights.

11:28
Data insights.

11:29
OK, yeah, yeah, that's what I was referring.

11:31
So that is under data sufficient.

11:34
So data insights is more than data sufficiency.

11:38
Yeah, yeah, of course.

11:40
Explain that only you you're able to see the whiteboard.

11:43
Yeah, yeah, correct.

11:44
So 3 sections, verbal, content, data, insights.

11:47
Verbal has 2 broad subsections, critical reasoning and reading comprehension.

11:51
Critical reasoning is where you're given a paragraph, you basically identify strengtheners, you evaluate the argument, you look at assumptions behind that argument.

11:59
So which is basically making sense out of a paragraph.

12:02
Reading comprehension is unseen passage, making sense out of a passage.

12:05
Then you have quant, it has 2 broad areas, arithmetic and algebra.

12:11
Arithmetic further has three areas number properties, even odd prime numbers, word problems, distance, speed, work rate and so on and advanced topics probability, permutation combination.

12:23
These topics data insights is four data sufficiency which is what we were talking about multi source easing two-part analysis and the fourth one is graphs and tables or in other words graphics interpretation and table analysis.

12:42
This is the broad overview of the exam.

12:45
And do you provide like part exams also mock exams like I I, I am yeah sectional mocks because I get what verbal and quantitative is but for DI and I have practice mostly data sufficiency till now.

13:01
So I just want to see like what type of questions is other 3 sections out correct?

13:06
So in the full course, we have 50 plus sectional mocks with individually you'll have 15 sectional mocks in verbal, 15 plus in quant and 15 plus in DI.

13:17
In the free trial course, you get one, one free sectional mock for each of these areas, verbal content, data, insights.

13:23
OK, one, one is there, right?

13:25
Absolutely.

13:26
Sure.

13:26
And in that they will also when when once submitted, they will also specify that this question was of which out of these four which path?

13:34
Yeah, absolutely.

13:36
Yeah.

13:36
OK.

13:37
And one more question.

13:37
So in quant you are telling that arithmetic and algebra, so there is no geometric lines.

13:43
And yes, there is no geometry.

13:46
No, there's no geometry, no geometric.

13:48
A couple of concepts are there in coordinate geometry, but that will cover as part of algebra only, but no geometry otherwise.

13:55
So the like back in the day in 10th in not in 10th, I think in 12th we used to do the lines and planes that is there or not No, OK, just couple of concepts in coordinate geometry that is it OK, sure, sure.

14:13
Right.

14:14
Any other questions, doubts and then no, I think I'm good with this, but I'll need at least this week so that on.

14:26
I'm planning since you said no that we don't, I don't need to give an exam at the exhausted state.

14:31
So I'm having that on probably Saturday morning I'll give full exam and then maybe Sunday morning, maybe Saturday sectional exams and Sunday morning I'll give the complete exam.

14:44
So after that I can flex every start I can plan to take the course.

14:49
So what do you suggest?

14:50
What will be the better like according to what you have got from my insights, Like what will be better one month or because I'm thinking one month will be a little crammed up time and maybe I feel like.

15:04
And one more question.

15:05
So if I feel at any time that I need extension to this, So what is the way to wait for that and what are the finances for that?

15:13
Correct.

15:14
Extensions are priced at $89.00 a month standard.

15:16
Whichever course you go for, be it one month, be it 2 month, there's a standard extension price of $89.00 a month.

15:21
So we'll at any point in time if you feel the need to extend the course, you'll have that option $89.00 a month.

15:29
OK.

15:30
And if I go for like 2 months, you were giving 112 months, $159, right, 159 as part of the promotion that we were running at that point in time.

15:43
It's not live right now, but I can take an approval and help you out with that.

15:47
Like two months at 159, yes, OK.

15:53
So do you think like two months will be sufficient for my preparation like the place I am in and the what I have I shared with you like what I have done till now?

16:06
So will two months will be sufficient or I need more than that, Correct.

16:10
So first thing is we don't know what your baseline score is right now.

16:14
So at this point in time, both of us, we don't know whether you're at A500 or A600 or a 555, we don't know that.

16:21
So once we have this.

16:22
So what we'll do is once you've taken the mock test, we'll do this session again.

16:28
I'll create a study plan for you, which will basically give you an understanding of what your strengths and weaknesses are, how much time you're looking at overall, what are the steps involved?

16:36
Do you need to cover foundations in any area or can we directly move to sectional mocks or taking full length mocks?

16:41
So we'll do this call again, then we'll create your study band and then it will give us a clearer picture of what your timeline should be.

16:49
Should you be looking at one month of prep?

16:50
Should you be looking at 2 month of prep or maybe more?

16:53
But mock will answer that question for us actually, correct, correct.

16:56
Actually my only concern this part is like I don't want my like I'm taking the course also and my like my money is getting wasted and I'm not able to achieve that.

17:09
So that's why I want to be totally sure before getting the course and everything, because see, the GMAT and everything is, we all know that it is an expensive affair.

17:19
It is correct.

17:20
After that, the exam will be there and going abroad.

17:23
So I'm, I'm trying to manage my finances so that I don't waste anything before even getting started.

17:30
Got it.

17:31
No, no, I appreciate the fact that you're careful with your finances.

17:34
So again, that, that, that is the reason why that second call would be needed so that we have a clear time.

17:39
Now, let me show you an example of what a study plan looks like.

17:43
Sure, what's and during this whole journey, like there will be different tutors or who'll be supporting me or who'll be like contacting me, correct.

17:53
I I'll explain the support as well.

17:55
So firstly, we'll look at the study plan.

17:57
Let me share my screen.

18:05
Are you able to see my screen?

18:09
Yeah.

18:09
OK.

18:10
Now, first thing is now what I was saying was the study plan, yes.

18:14
So based on where you stand right now, the course has an AI driven study plan which we can create in our next section, our next session.

18:21
In that study plan, to create that high level plan, you'll need three things.

18:25
Your starting score, your target score and the time that you can devote every week with that study plan will give you based on your current instance and weaknesses, a clear personalized target for each area.

18:36
So you'll have different goals even in critical reasoning and eating comprehension or the DI areas or quant areas as well.

18:43
And based on your time investment, it will also give you a clear cut timeline.

18:47
So for example, CR to go from 57 percentile to 95 percentile, you'll let's say take about 1.6 weeks of effort.

18:53
So study plan will give you the timelines in that much depth.

18:57
And for an individual area like wobble, it will show you the your time investment as well.

19:01
Well overall, so this guy for example, to go from 48 percentile to 97 percentile will take about 90 hours of effort.

19:07
You'll have that info.

19:08
This is your total preparation time.

19:10
It will include time to work on any foundations if needed, practicing section marks, full length marks.

19:16
All of that time is included and basis that you get a tentative exam date.

19:21
So right from the beginning, you can see what kind of timeline you are looking at.

19:24
Are you looking at one month, 2 month or maybe more?

19:27
We can we can look create that plan and know for sure.

19:30
Plus study plan will also give you the individual steps that you need to take on a particular area like critical reasoning or reading comprehension.

19:38
For example, 2 steps in critical reasoning, we need to cover foundations.

19:43
We need to cement those foundations by doing a structured and targeted practice.

19:46
And for these steps, you'll get the hourly estimate as well how many hours you'll need for completing that step.

19:52
So will not only get this data step by step plan, it will also be in the right sequence.

19:57
Should you do verbal for should you do quant?

19:59
What should be the order?

20:00
Verbal is recommended that you do it first because variety of concepts is lesser.

20:04
DI should be covered last because verbal and con concepts are going to be helpful in learning.

20:08
DI will study, man will give you these and to track your progress continuously, you'll get this tracker.

20:16
Exactly what you need to do on a given day is given to you.

20:18
Once you complete the task, you can mark it as completed.

20:20
It will then be crossed off.

20:22
You can adjust your hours.

20:23
For example, this day you committed to two hours, but you find your you took a leave let's say from work, maybe you can devote 4 hours so you can save it and close it accordingly.

20:30
Your time, not your study plan will align with it.

20:33
So that's so even moving it from 2:00 to 4:00 hours.

20:35
So will the task increase or something like it will be adjusted.

20:39
It will be adjusted basically you by design you will have one learning activity in a day.

20:44
But again, so let's say doing master combination course, the human effort is 7 hours since we are devoting 2 two hours every day.

20:52
The 4th day it's we can devote 5 hours but overall effort is 7 hours.

20:57
And by 22 to 24th we'll have six hours.

21:01
But by design, we are not starting a new learning activity on a particular day, which is exactly what's mentioned here.

21:06
So you won't get multiple tasks in a day.

21:07
But again, let's say one hour on this day we complete the course.

21:11
You're not exhausted, not fatigue.

21:12
You can definitely start with the next step, that is anyway.

21:15
Sure.

21:18
And one more thing.

21:18
So suppose after giving the mock exam, I feel like I only need the test series.

21:25
I don't require the full course.

21:27
So is there that option as well as like 10 tests given to me?

21:32
Unfortunately, no.

21:33
Like I mentioned in my e-mail, we don't have courses that cater to let's say just the mock test or just verbal, just **** just TI because, and there's a reason for it because a mock by itself is a diagnostic tool.

21:48
It tells you what your current ability is at a particular point in time.

21:52
For example, let's say the student takes a mock and he gets a 665.

21:58
Let's say he wants a 7:05.

22:00
Now the analysis, this is only diagnostic data.

22:04
This is only telling us where you're strong, where you need more help.

22:07
But let's say if this guy were to improve quant, we need to go deeper into what exactly his gaps are.

22:13
Let's say arithmetic is a 77 percentile and we need to improve on this area.

22:18
Then your practice data becomes very, very crucial.

22:21
How would you improve arithmetic?

22:23
Let's say within arithmetic, we just want to talk.

22:25
We just want to see how to improve in number properties.

22:29
Now your topic was data is very important.

22:31
We see that divisibility and is a strong topic, but estimation rounding is a weak topic.

22:36
Especially the timing issues are there, plus hard questions.

22:38
Accuracy is not that great.

22:40
Now, if this is a problematic topic, you'll need access to the foundation course to fix this particular topic.

22:48
In this case, estimation and rounding, you'll need to revise the concept.

22:53
You'll need to revise the approach.

22:54
So that is why an integrated courses, courses very much needed because mock only gives you your ability at a particular point in time.

23:02
So that's the reason why we don't offer different courses, I mean section specific or content specific courses.

23:10
But let's say if you're only interested in mock, let's say let's say you're not, you already had a good ability, you just want to work on your test readiness and you want 6 new mocks, then go for a short course.

23:21
No, then go for a one month course at $99.

23:24
Or let's say if or you want to let's say take mocks in 15 days, we can give you a 15 day course it at $49.00.

23:31
It will still have the entire content, but so basically I can shuffle my time according to what my abilities got it.

23:41
And OK, this is one Part 1 extremity of the spectrum, but let's move to the other one.

23:46
So suppose I need like I did five.

23:50
You're saying that we have 5 full mock tests, right?

23:53
Yes.

23:53
So now suppose like even after five I need some more mock test.

23:58
So what is the way to get that?

24:00
Like it is it will will it be provided as in the course or I need to take another course like what?

24:08
What will be that correct.

24:09
So the course overall has five mocks.

24:12
So it's not that we hold back any mocks from a student and then you know for an additional course, give those mocks.

24:18
No core course has five mocks.

24:20
Now let's say you exhaust these mocks.

24:21
First thing is you ideally should not be in a position where you have exhausted the Mogs and you still need further improvement.

24:28
Why?

24:29
Because if a mock tells you that you are at a 665, you want to go to a 715.

24:32
Better to do course correction before you take the next mock firstly.

24:36
So ideally we should not be in a situation like this.

24:39
But let's say in the event that happens, first thing is you get 2 free mocks on mba.com.

24:44
I I hope you're aware of that.

24:46
You do.

24:47
You can retake those mocks as well.

24:50
In fact, in the first retake most of the questions are new SO2 free you get there.

24:53
Mocks 326 are available for a purchase on mba.com, that official website of GMAC, the console that runs the exam.

25:00
So then you go for mocks 326.

25:02
The retail price of those is close to 108 dollars.

25:05
If I if my memory serves right, EGMAR students can get those official mocks at a discount.

25:10
So in case you want to go for 326, you can write to the team, they'll tell you the available discount offer.

25:15
Then you can get the three mocks 326 at a discount from mb.com.

25:20
OK, but ideally these fives are sufficient, correct?

25:25
Ideally, these five are sufficient, correct?

25:28
Because only the first mock is what you'll take right now, the free trial one.

25:32
The rest 4 you'll take towards the end of your journey.

25:34
Once verbal content DI, everything is sorted, foundations are done, you have practice, You've taken sectional mocks, Sure.

25:41
And now suppose like if I have some doubts in the like, I give them all, then I have sectional partner, then have doubts.

25:48
So who'll be the support system, correct.

25:52
Like what is support?

25:54
So two kinds of support.

25:55
One is subject matter support.

25:57
Now let's pick any video lesson.

25:59
Let's say, let's pick this topic impact of only and all and inference in critical reasoning.

26:05
No, the doubt could be, let's say related to the concept or the solution of a question.

26:08
Right here, you'll have the doubt claim feature.

26:10
Do you have a question?

26:11
Click on yes, you're taken to the forums.

26:13
The forums is where you can post your query.

26:16
Our subject matter experts respond to that query within a business day and the discussion log is maintained.

26:22
So 90% of the times you'll see somebody has already asked the concern that you have.

26:25
You can see the response and clarify your doubts on the spot.

26:28
Don't have to ask anything, don't have to post anything.

26:31
Like majority of the time to go 30,000 plus queries are already addressed.

26:35
Individual more question solution will also have this same ask and expert feature.

26:38
Individual question bank solution questions will also have the same ask and expert feature.

26:43
This is what your subject matter help.

26:45
Now we also have strategy support, or in other words, dedicated mentor support.

26:50
You'll be assigned a dedicated mentor, a strategy expert that individual guides you throughout your journey every step of the way.

26:57
So wherever you need feedback on your course progress or you need help with your prep strategy, or let's say CR, your accuracy is not improving at the medium level.

27:06
You reach out to your mentor.

27:08
Your mentor will analyze your course data at the back end, then they'll come back with the advice.

27:12
All you need to do to access that support is just drop an e-mail within a business day.

27:15
Your mentor will analyze your course data, then they'll come back with the advice what you should be revising what kind of courses you need to be taking so you can leverage that supports route you preference.

27:25
Sure.

27:25
And that mentor will be like in contact with me on e-mail only or what's up?

27:31
Also emails, emails because The thing is emails allow us to keep everything on record.

27:36
You or your mentor can refer to a past communication at a later point if needed.

27:40
One second thing is, let's say if your mentor is unavailable on a particular day, he or she is on a leave, then another mentor would jump in.

27:46
They'll look at the e-mail communication, they'll analyze your code data.

27:48
They'll pick up exactly where the previous person left off.

27:51
So this way your continuity will also not be Hanford.

27:53
So that's why we use e-mail as that medium.

27:56
But if OK, I got it, that is one way.

27:58
But if I want like to be in touch on WhatsApp also.

28:03
So is that a possibility or not?

28:05
No, no, no.

28:06
Again, same reason we keep e-mail as the mode of communication.

28:11
OK, OK, sure, sure.

28:14
I think I'm good, but first I need to see where I stand and then I'll decide.

28:19
Got it.

28:20
Makes sense.

28:21
So when are you planning on taking the mock test?

28:24
This weekend, This weekend?

28:27
So meanwhile, do explore the free trial codes.

28:29
What I'll do today after call is I'll write a detailed e-mail to help you get started.

28:33
It will have the mock link and the free trialing and some other useful links of the course.

28:38
