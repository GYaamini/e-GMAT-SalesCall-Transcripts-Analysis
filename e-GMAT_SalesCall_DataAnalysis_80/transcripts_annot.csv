105,02:23,"Hey, , , you are on mute if you are talking.",unknown
105,02:32,Hello.,unknown
105,02:33,"Yeah, hi.",unknown
105,02:34,Hello.,unknown
105,02:35,"Yeah, .",unknown
105,02:36,"So, yeah, so we had a fair level first, you know, first level discussion in WhatsApp where you said you just starting your prep and want to take in the month of July.",agent
105,02:47,Yeah.,prospect
105,02:48,"So, so a couple of things I would like to ask is you are currently working Apna?",agent
105,02:53,"Yeah, I am currently working.",prospect
105,02:54,I have an experience of around 6 years.,prospect
105,02:58,"OK, OK, that's good.",agent
105,02:59,that's good.,agent
105,03:00,"And so, so I just want to understand you are looking for the round one application if I am not round one application for this year, right?",agent
105,03:11,"Yeah, round one application.",prospect
105,03:12,what's your target schools?,agent
105,03:14,My target schools are ISPI am also exploring the IIM.,prospect
105,03:20,"I am BGP, PGPX and also NCI at Singapore.",prospect
105,03:26,"OK, so majorly India is specific and then yeah, NCR is one option for you.",agent
105,03:32,Mostly I am going towards India.,prospect
105,03:35,"OK, understood.",agent
105,03:37,So even even say ISV offers up to 100% scholarship and wrong applications for the great team as go.,agent
105,03:44,"So you know, you have that, you know, right now at least you're not in the month of say April of May, You are at least the month of February so that you would have Apple Railway to actually, you know, prepare and get it started.",agent
105,03:58,"So before this, have you taken any test or no, just coming out of group.",agent
105,04:04,I haven't taken any test.,prospect
105,04:06,I gave cat when I was in college like back in 2018 and gotten percentile of 77 if I remember.,prospect
105,04:16,OK alright so so in this call I assume that you updated Naive 2 even you know you have done a basic research about eating right?,agent
105,04:27,But still I would like to give you an overview.,agent
105,04:30,"So, you know, before I give a complete understanding, I, I would be sharing you 2 short videos, very short videos which you have to watch to understand at a surface level in a very concentrated way that because it is in a very short video comprising of a lot of things.",agent
105,04:49,And when I after that you would have some questions invoked in you.,agent
105,04:53,"And when I explain you things, then it will be a bit more clearer rather than I am just maybe just directly started.",agent
105,04:59,"So I will send you that right now in that in the chat box, just, you know, check that out.",agent
105,05:08,I am just mentioning as video one and video 2 for that order.,agent
105,05:14,So I have send a video one.,agent
105,05:17,The video one is regarding the course overview and video 2 is regarding the mental support.,agent
105,05:22,We have a dedicated mental support for our program.,agent
105,05:25,So how how does this work?,agent
105,05:27,"You would have some questions once you finish it, but of course I am there to you know, help you with that.",agent
105,05:31,So yeah.,agent
105,05:33,So these are the 2 videos which you can watch right now.,agent
105,05:38,We will be on mute.,agent
105,05:38,I will be waiting for you.,agent
105,05:40,So once you are done just unmute and say hi.,agent
105,05:42,I will.,prospect
105,05:43,I will.,agent
105,05:43,We will discuss at that point.,agent
105,05:46,"OK, Yeah, I will watch and I will let you know.",prospect
105,05:50,"Sure, sure.",agent
105,05:50,I will be here.,agent
105,05:51,Yeah.,agent
105,19:41,"Hi, Amrit.",unknown
105,19:46,Hello.,unknown
105,19:47,"Yeah, Yeah, I went to these videos.",prospect
105,19:50,Yeah.,prospect
105,19:51,So I hope that would have given you a fair understanding of how we are going to approach the GMAT as a whole.,agent
105,19:57,And yeah.,agent
105,19:58,So what do you feel?,agent
105,19:59,"So you know, what is it that you have got from the video, Kavina?",agent
105,20:04,"Yeah, I understood like the complete walkthrough of what things are there, How?",prospect
105,20:09,Right.,prospect
105,20:10,"I can have a look at the videos, classes, the Marks and how the mentor will help me and give me the like the agenda, right?",prospect
105,20:18,Both of the things I need to focus on.,prospect
105,20:21,"Correct, correct.",agent
105,20:22,"And also as you progress your journey, you are going to leave a trail of data footprints which is being utilised for, you know for for your last leg of your breath.",agent
105,20:33,"Yeah, that is see the mentorship program you have already seen in that video you know majorly through emails and chats and that is only till phase one.",agent
105,20:42,So the complete mentorship for the complete prep is divided to 2 phases.,agent
105,20:46,"Phase one is still you reach a particular level of around 8080 to 80 percentile, around 6.5625 is when you would have phase one and then Phase 2.",agent
105,20:56,"So what happens in phase one is once you hit that particular 80 to 85 percentile, what as an output, what what can we expect is you would by then know how to solve all questions because GMAT unlike CAT or other tests where you know you have to have the very depth of understanding.",agent
105,21:12,Here the depth is from the focus.,agent
105,21:13,"Here the technique is the focus because the depth is very shallow, right.",agent
105,21:16,There are very limited types of questions that can ever come in your GMAT.,agent
105,21:20,"And once you identify those types and you know work on it, there is nothing new that you are going to see for your first time in your test.",agent
105,21:27,But all that matters is having that high optimised efficiency.,agent
105,21:31,So the first objective ways to make sure that you know how to solve all questions may be not.,agent
105,21:36,"If not, see the average time that you would require or you would get for solving questions in G matrix around 2 minutes.",agent
105,21:43,"For verbal, you have 23 questions for 45 minutes, just about 2 minutes.",agent
105,21:47,"Quants 21 minutes, you know just below 2 minutes.",agent
105,21:50,"And for quants 21 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.",agent
105,21:54,"And data insights, again 20 questions for 45 minutes, just below 2 minutes.",agent
105,21:58,So on an average if you just see it is all you know close to 2 minutes of time is what you would have for your test the reason of your question.,agent
105,22:06,"So even if you take 33 and a half minutes on an average or 3 minutes on an average, its OK if you are getting the right answer in the phase one.",agent
105,22:14,So that is the objective.,agent
105,22:15,"There are 64 questions, at least 63 to 64 questions or at least in the worst case 62 questions you should be able to solve in that you know relax time environment and till then you would have your mental support majorly via you know.",agent
105,22:30,I will share my screen also for for you to have an understanding if I if I take say a critical tracing or any of the sections.,agent
105,22:39,"Yeah, this is the chat window.",agent
105,22:41,"You know that that they are going to have where you know whenever you ping your mentor, you are going to get a pop up.",agent
105,22:47,They are going to get a pop up and they ping you.,agent
105,22:48,"You are going to get a pop up and whenever it is not just in chat, you are also going to get a mail of it.",agent
105,22:54,So you know you are going to get the communication recorded in your mail by default.,agent
105,22:59,So that is going to be there and you know chat does not necessarily mean typing.,agent
105,23:03,It could be the loop videos which which you know you have just watched our loop videos.,agent
105,23:07,So it would not take much time for your mentor to create a short loop video to explain you rather than just typing and creating a confusion.,agent
105,23:14,"So you know, generally we prefer that and if it is something pretty straightforward, we will just type and send it to you as well.",agent
105,23:20,"So that is how it is going to be in phase one and once you enter Phase 2 that is once you reach a capability to solve all questions that comes in front of you, you require a dedicated you know, you know structure or a strategy to now get all the questions in under less than 2 minutes.",agent
105,23:39,And how does it happen?,agent
105,23:40,It happens through our flagship program called the Last Mile Push.,agent
105,23:43,"So you know when we say it is a program, it is a different program.",agent
105,23:46,You know don't get into the things that it is going to be additional charge.,agent
105,23:50,"It is inclusive within the course because what we believe is nobody enrolls in a course for you know, getting a 615 rates everyone gets in a course, you know gets gets a course for getting a high score.",agent
105,24:01:00,So we don't charge anything extra for it.,agent
105,24:04:00,"But the idea is once you start or you know, the idea is the first objective that you need to get is to hit that particular personnel to be eligible for this.",agent
105,24:16:00,"And all all the students that you would see if you have follow, if you have been following us on YouTube, you would have seen that we are actually having the highest number of success rate compared to almost the top global platforms you went towards from the second test.",agent
105,24:30:00,"And, and everybody that you would see in our YouTube channel.",agent
105,24:33:00,"I will I will just quickly show you as well that you know, the you know, they have gone through the last minute push program where you would have one on one session with your mentors.",agent
105,24:41:00,"Beyond that, once you are once you enter the last minute push program, it will not be chat or meal, but it will be one on one session that you would have a with your mentor where the complete agenda is for fine tuning and time management.",agent
105,24:52:00,That will be the only focus in the last minute push program.,agent
105,24:55:00,"So, so some students directly enrolled for last week which program also who already have given their actual test.",agent
105,25:02:00,"And this is one of the students who got a 625 in an actual test and you know, joined us.",agent
105,25:09:00,"She gave, she had she was running on deadline, had only around 17 days and had another test.",agent
105,25:15:00,She joined us for 15 days and and got to a 695 score.,agent
105,25:21:00,"So, you know, we have a lot of scenarios and we have students who get 725 just you just need to do only one thing.",agent
105,25:28:00,"If you are looking for a 700 plus, see just to give you a context, you know the median of the median score for ISB is 655.",agent
105,25:35:00,"For I, I, Ms is also around 655.",agent
105,25:38:00,And for NCR the median score is around 675685.,agent
105,25:42:00,"You need to score, you need to plan at least 2030 points on top of the median score to get an interview call.",agent
105,25:49:00,"And for ISB, if you are targeting a 715 or like A908909 percentile, you can get up to 100% scholarships also.",agent
105,25:56:00,So that should be a focus provided the time frame that you have got right.,agent
105,26:01:00,So we have a lot of such examples.,agent
105,26:03:00,We would find a lot of students who are getting A908909 percentile on a monthly basis.,agent
105,26:08:00,You would find plenty.,agent
105,26:10:00,So you know that is one thing.,agent
105,26:11:00,"And regarding GMAT Club, which is the world's largest community of all the GMAT aspirin sectors of globe, you would find, you know, we having the highest number of reviews, verified reviews for getting posted 2.8 K.",agent
105,26:26:00,The second best is TDP.,agent
105,26:27:00,You would find it is almost half.,agent
105,26:30:00,And then you would find the average rating is 4.7 out of 5.,agent
105,26:33:00,And almost everyone would be talking about how the last mail push program has been helpful and how the journey has been helpful throughout their prep and all these things.,agent
105,26:42:00,So just you also give you a context.,agent
105,26:44:00,"I would like to show you one of the students, you know, who came back to prep after a really long time.",agent
105,26:54:00,So let me just open it up to somewhere here.,agent
105,26:59:00,So he came back after 20 years of work eggs.,agent
105,27:03:00,"You know, when when someone comes back after 20 years of work eggs, you know, you would pretty much be, you know, you pretty much understand that, you know, they, they are practically starting from that Ground Zero.",agent
105,27:14:00,"So this is one of the students who came back to prep after, you know, around 19 years of work case after 20 years that he came back to academics and got to a score of 685.",agent
105,27:27:00,"And there are other examples as well who have done that, who has done that in their journey.",agent
105,27:32:00,"So, so most people will talk about how the Olympic program has been successful where, you know, like the way I said, no extra cost provided you are already at a good level that is around 80th percentile level.",agent
105,27:42:00,"So to boost a peer score and this is also another student who came after 20 years of work eggs, you know, so when these people can do anybody can do that, that is the idea.",agent
105,27:55:00,"So you know, when someone gets 20 plus years of experience can come in and you know, crack it and get A6856959798 percentile, you know, we we can do because it is it is a standard process that has to follow.",agent
105,28:09:00,We cover from the fundamentals.,agent
105,28:10:00,"But of course, even if you look at quants, let us assume that if it is quants, maybe there is a fact that you know, you may not know.",agent
105,28:19:00,"Say let us assume that 60% of things, so 70% of the things you do not know, at least 3030% of the things you might remember it, you might know.",agent
105,28:25:00,"So what we have in the quantity is something called personalised adaptive course engine, we call it PACE.",agent
105,28:30:00,"What it does is within each of the modules, you would have a diagnostic quiz.",agent
105,28:34:00,"Based on how you perform in the diagnostic quiz, we capture multiple data, your average correct time, incorrect time, accuracy, time pressure management, all these things and then recommend you to take only those particular files where you are going to have a definitive learning.",agent
105,28:47:00,And we are going to recommend you to skip the files which you have already mastered or you are already a master it.,agent
105,28:53:00,So by that way you are not spending.,agent
105,28:55:00,Suppose here you got 100 percentage recommended none here you got 100 percentage but still recommended to the files because maybe you know how to solve the question.,agent
105,29:03:00,"But if you attend these 2 files, you are going to have a better technique which will help you in your you know technique aspect.",agent
105,29:10:00,"Decimals 100 percentage recommended 4 of the 8 files because of course you know how to solve questions, but you have a better technique.",agent
105,29:16:00,But does it does not mean that you cannot take all those.,agent
105,29:19:00,You can just turn off face and still do it.,agent
105,29:21:00,"You have the complete control, but face will give you that recommendation to skip.",agent
105,29:24:00,"You can see here right Apart from that, you would have already seen the journey view where the complete prep bibit bubble quant or DI.",agent
105,29:34:00,"You would have this journey view where you would see how well you are doing compared to your peers across the global population, how well you are doing with respect to them for each other particular file.",agent
105,29:45:00,If you're doing better than then we get a grade A.,agent
105,29:46:00,"If you're doing at par with them, we get a grade B.",agent
105,29:48:00,"And if you're doing below the bench, you get a grade C.",agent
105,29:51:00,"And for each of the grade should have a definitive set of actions to do, which your mentor would define you very clearly before you start or initiate.",agent
105,29:57:00,So you know that is fun thing.,agent
105,29:59:00,"So it's a demand is a competitive test, right?",agent
105,30:01:00,So it's better to keep that competitive spirit as we learn to have a clear understanding of how well we are going in terms of the plan that we are doing.,agent
105,30:09:00,"And this test that you are are you know the journey, view the greats and all these things are not based on what you have, what you had, you know what you have learned outside, its majorly based on what you have learned from our platform.",agent
105,30:22:00,So you are being tested in those quizzes towards the end on what we teach in that particular file.,agent
105,30:27:00,"Suppose if you are teaching you on a very simple, very basic terms, if you are teaching you 3 + 5 equal to 8, they are just gonna check 5 + 7.",agent
105,30:35:00,"Are you able to get it as you know 12 That is the objective that we are going to, you know, look at and if you are getting it going to the right track and how, how fast should we calculate that just to give you a analogy.",agent
105,30:47:00,So that that is one thing.,agent
105,30:49:00,And the second thing is the study planner you have already seen we will be creating a study planner which should be flexible.,agent
105,30:54:00,"Suppose when you the particular day you it is, it is 2 hours that you have committed but you could do only one hour you are going to mark it as you know one hour and accordingly a calendar will exist itself or maybe you committed to us cannot study at all.",agent
105,31:07:00,You are going to mark it as a no study day.,agent
105,31:08:00,But let us assume that they turned out to be holiday.,agent
105,31:11:00,You could keep say 5 hours you are going to move as 5 hours according to your calendar legs.,agent
105,31:17:00,"So you know, so as you start you would have a customised study plan and it is it is very unique for a particular study.",agent
105,31:23:00,It is like a fingerprint because to a great extent this is a skeleton.,agent
105,31:27:00,"We would say this is skeleton, the flesh and the skin would be a mentor would be building on top of the skeleton based on what you need.",agent
105,31:34:00,"So that is the that is a, you know, custom approach that you would take towards the test.",agent
105,31:38:00,"And yeah, then we have multi stage learning since Ch 2, you would go.",agent
105,31:45:00,"And so so the data that we would be capturing here is if you just go to the skill data would find if it is CR within CR for each of the particular topics, there are 9 topics for each of the particular topics.",agent
105,31:55:00,How is your accuracy?,agent
105,31:57:00,"How is your average correct time, incorrect time, block level analysis?",agent
105,32:00:00,"Then if it is RC, then what are the different topics that challenges you or you know troubles you?",agent
105,32:05:00,"Then if you look at you know, quants within quants properties, word problems, advanced topics is your arithmetic, you are still bifurcated.",agent
105,32:13:00,So how well you are doing in these particular types of files and all the things and the same goes to data inside as well.,agent
105,32:18:00,We have a dedicated DI course.,agent
105,32:20:00,"If you just see like quant and verbal, we have a dedicated DI course which should cover the whole aspect where we teach you from the fundamentals.",agent
105,32:27:00,"If you take graphic interpretation, table analysis, you would learn from the fundamentals.",agent
105,32:30:00,So you know it is a dedicated full length course.,agent
105,32:33:00,"It is in some platforms still are following that old classic format with you know they just add a couple of files in DI as an extension to quant, not as a dedicated section which is to be considered as a dedicated section, right.",agent
105,32:47:00,So that is why the test also has separate section for it.,agent
105,32:51:00,So you will have a dedicated full length course for DI as Welland of course like the way I said you will have full length mocks.,agent
105,32:57:00,We will have subsectional marks.,agent
105,32:59:00,"So you will have around 90 plus sectional marks around you know around 100 subsectional marks just for CR, just for RC this for arithmetic algebra, just for DS like data inserts all the 4 sections and you will have custom courses for targeted learning.",agent
105,33:13:00,If if I take let us say I have all I have been showing quad.,agent
105,33:17:00,So lets let me show you say this one.,agent
105,33:21:00,"If I take what problems we can actually or algebra, we can actually do targeted learning for that by going and just selecting the areas that we need to work on and then do a targeted learning for each of the types of questions.",agent
105,33:34:00,Same goes for data insights as well.,agent
105,33:38:00,"You can, you can come here and do targeted learning.",agent
105,33:40:00,"So, so there is a lot that you can do with this platform and, and this is television.",agent
105,33:46:00,"You do not have to purchase anything else for your, you know, GMAT club.",agent
105,33:51:00,"So that is that is one thing to go here data sufficiency, you have these many types of questions for each type of question we can do targeted learning.",agent
105,33:57:00,"There are certain probability, there are special reasoning, there are number of properties, there are statistics or beat any of the sections you are going to have the same yeah.",agent
105,34:06:00,So that's that's the whole aspect.,agent
105,34:09:00,Now over to you.,agent
105,34:10:00,"If you have any questions, you know we have covered comprehensively, but still you might have some questions if so we can discuss right now.",agent
105,34:18:00,"Yes, so, so I will let me just give me the like what is the plans and pricing because I have few questions around it.",prospect
105,34:28:00,"OK, you are looking for 4 months, right?",agent
105,34:31:00,I can go for 6 months also.,prospect
105,34:35:00,OK.,agent
105,34:35:00,"So 6 months is priced at 3:00, $99 and 4 months in the platform is $299.",agent
105,34:44:00,So 299 is around 2590399 is around 34500.,agent
105,34:54:00,So that's the pricing and we also have live classes which I don't recommend you to purchase right away but rather if you once you get into the selfish and I will tell you what happens in the live class like any other you know platforms giving you a live class in like any of the institute that gives you a live class across the globe.,agent
105,35:13:00,You are going to have an instructor coming in and they will be solving questions and you will be learning through solving.,agent
105,35:18:00,That's approach that it has been there since existence for all life class across the globe.,agent
105,35:22:00,So you are going to have the same here as well.,agent
105,35:25:00,But you have to contribute on multiple things.,agent
105,35:28:00,You know GMAT is a test where there are working professionals and the the live class happens only at a fixed time.,agent
105,35:35:00,So you know if it is a recorded session then what is the purpose of taking a live class?,agent
105,35:39:00,Live class has to be live.,agent
105,35:40:00,So you know the timing.,agent
105,35:42:00,Does it suit you?,agent
105,35:44:00,"Probably it will be in the evening everyday you will have sessions, you know, 5 to 6 days a week you would have sessions in the evening.",agent
105,35:52:00,"And even if you take live class, live classes not a replacement for the self base because there are certain limitations for life class where all the data that we capture which we use in the last minute push program because the fine tuning towards the later part is very important.",agent
105,36:05:00,Because see a student can buy themselves get to a 615 score at 1:00 point of time.,agent
105,36:10:00,Maybe with a dedicated course you would get there in say 4 months.,agent
105,36:14:00,"If not with a dedicated course, they might take one year, that is the difference.",agent
105,36:17:00,"But eventually with the free materials online, YouTube and all these things, you would eventually get to a position where in GMAT you would know how to solve all questions because the the syllabus is limited.",agent
105,36:27:00,So the idea is to optimise.,agent
105,36:29:00,"So most students would get plateaued there and then they will be stuck because they don't have, we don't have the data to, you know, proceed further to identify what exactly has to be dealt with.",agent
105,36:38:00,"So, so life class is never a replacement of selfish but an extension if you have more time.",agent
105,36:44:00,"So what I would suggest is if you even want to try, you can take free couple of live sessions and see if it is actually helping you to a great extent.",agent
105,36:53:00,"And if you feel that OK this is something which I definitely want to go for, go for it after taking 2 of the live classes.",agent
105,36:59:00,"And also I will also show even if you take a self paced course, you are still going to have webinars.",agent
105,37:04:00,"But the catch is webinars happens every Saturday, Sunday you will find that you know 11:00 AM IST.",agent
105,37:12:00,So webinars are in self paged also like self based also it's going to be there.,agent
105,37:15:00,"But the catches in webinars around 100 because it's not something which we charge extra, right.",agent
105,37:20:00,"So around 100, 100 to 150 students might join in, in, in a session.",agent
105,37:25:00,"So it's going to be your, all your doubts may not be cleared there.",agent
105,37:29:00,But in the live class it will be a batch of 3 to 5.,agent
105,37:31:00,That's the difference.,agent
105,37:32:00,OK.,prospect
105,37:33:00,"And any other differences in self paid versus live sessions like mock and everything are covered in both, right.",prospect
105,37:39:00,"We, we have a student.",agent
105,37:41:00,"Yeah, yeah, everything is same.",agent
105,37:42:00,"And to to give you a context, we have a student who got a 765 in GMAT focus just with self based.",agent
105,37:50:00,So 765 is way above that 100 percentile that 735 is 100 percentile.,agent
105,37:54:00,So 765 is a really high score with just self placed.,agent
105,37:59:00,Yeah.,agent
105,38:00:00,"So you know, that is enough to be precise.",agent
105,38:03:00,"And generally life class are taken by our majority of the crowd that takes live class and majorly students who are still studying and then people who have taken a sabbatical kind of you know from from work and you know, they have ample time.",agent
105,38:18:00,So they would go for that.,agent
105,38:20:00,So that is a major crowd.,agent
105,38:22:00,"Yeah, self phase would work for me.",prospect
105,38:23:00,"But yeah, I will be going for 6 months considering I have time.",prospect
105,38:28:00,"And anyway, is there any extension possible if the 6 months over and I want like a 2 months extension, See we can go for even 15 days extension or one month extension also for $49 or 115 days, 16 days $49.",agent
105,38:44:00,"You know, one week extension is $29 and say one month extension is $89.",agent
105,38:52:00,So we have all the flexibility at that point of time.,agent
105,38:54:00,"But generally in in your case, how many hours a week in a week, how many hours are you planning to study?",agent
105,39:00:00,Like what's your.,agent
105,39:02:00,Yeah.,prospect
105,39:03:00,"So my agenda would be like in weekdays I can study for 2 hours OK, 2 to 10 hours.",prospect
105,39:10:00,Yeah.,prospect
105,39:10:00,And then on weekends I can study for like 5 hours.,prospect
105,39:14:00,So 20 hours time.,prospect
105,39:16:00,We shouldn't be taking more than 6 months.,agent
105,39:17:00,"To be honest, you should be even if you started a score as low as 300 kind of thing, you should be able to pull it off because a journey from 300 to 500 is going to be very short because it is like an exponential curve.",agent
105,39:29:00,"Your learning is going to be that once you hit that 555 you you feel that each, each increment of point is a bit slow from that point.",agent
105,39:39:00,So till then it is going to be pretty safe.,agent
105,39:41:00,So some even if you start at 3:55 till 555 is just around one 1/2 months of time that extra that you take.,agent
105,39:48:00,So basically you should be getting to last mile push program by around 44 months even if you start late.,agent
105,39:56:00,So you know you should be up there.,agent
105,39:58:00,So should not be taking more than with with the schedule that you have set consistently we are giving in say 20 hours without fail every week.,agent
105,40:05:00,Should not be taking more than 6 months.,agent
105,40:07:00,It should be done with it in 5 to end of months for sure.,agent
105,40:11:00,Got it.,prospect
105,40:12:00,Yeah and then there's no like book hard copy and books and all required.,prospect
105,40:17:00,Everything would be like online.,prospect
105,40:18:00,"No, everything is online and you know yeah.",agent
105,40:22:00,Do we have online some notes or those kind of also things available on the portal or it's just like the questions and the explanations around that?,prospect
105,40:31:00,"See regarding the notes as every time you finish it, you are going to get a summary which is downloadable.",agent
105,40:37:00,So you know you can you can you can download that as a short notes.,agent
105,40:42:00,And we generally recommend you to take create a small so you get some instructions as well as you progress where each of the particular file you have something new you learn.,agent
105,40:52:00,You just have to take a note of that just to use it as a slash slash kind of things.,agent
105,40:57:00,So you will be given instruction on that.,agent
105,40:59:00,So that is not a trouble.,agent
105,41:03:00,"Yeah, I think I am good then.",prospect
105,41:05:00,And then the study plan things.,prospect
105,41:07:00,Will you be sharing right now or it is like once I enroll for the class?,prospect
105,41:10:00,"Once you once you enroll, the first thing that you would be asked to is take the first Sigma X mock.",agent
105,41:16:00,"Once you enroll, the first thing that you would be asked to do is you will have to take a full length test through us which will be considered as a diagnostic test.",agent
105,41:24:00,And based on which you would be building your profile even if it is low or high does not matter.,agent
105,41:29:00,We are going to create a profile based out of the mock.,agent
105,41:32:00,So give 2 and half hours.,agent
105,41:35:00,So make sure that you are not doing something in between doing parallel works.,agent
105,41:39:00,Make sure that you are in the in the right.,agent
105,41:41:00,"Say suppose if you are Saturday, Sunday, if you are available today, if you are taking it today, make sure that till 2 and half hours nobody is disturbing you.",agent
105,41:48:00,You are finishing it and then then it is done for the day.,agent
105,41:51:00,So you can look into it.,agent
105,41:53:00,"So when I plan to start, I am planning to start from like probably next week onwards because I am a bit occupied this weekend.",prospect
105,42:03:00,OK.,agent
105,42:04:00,"And any like discount, anything possible for the course.",prospect
105,42:09:00,"See, once you decide, let me know.",agent
105,42:12:00,"So at that point of time, if any discounts runs or something can be given, we, we can work on it.",agent
105,42:18:00,"So whenever you decide that hey, I am, I am planning to start say tomorrow, just give me a call one day prior or give me a message one day prior.",agent
105,42:26:00,"I will message you once it confirm, Yeah.",prospect
105,42:29:00,"So probably by next Saturday, right?",prospect
105,42:31:00,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.",agent
105,42:35:00,Alright.,agent
105,42:35:00,"So keep me posted, just give me a message on Friday.",agent
105,42:38:00,I will.,prospect
105,42:39:00,Maybe we can get on a short WhatsApp call or normal call for a couple of minutes to discuss the pricing if anything further can be done.,agent
105,42:47:00,"Yeah, we can discuss on that.",prospect
105,42:48:00,Yeah.,prospect
105,42:49:00,And one last thing.,prospect
105,42:51:00,So is there any like the group or like WhatsApp to my Telegram group with your form of all the students where we can discuss the doubts?,prospect
105,42:57:00,"Or if I have any doubts, is there any email I can drop like kind of a doubt solving?",prospect
105,43:02:00,You can simply see if any particular doubt is there.,agent
105,43:05:00,"You have a forum within the, each of the questions would have a separate forum for you to put a doubt.",agent
105,43:11:00,But that is what the second is.,agent
105,43:13:00,"If if your doubt is not getting cleared, you can reach out to your vendor to help you.",agent
105,43:17:00,So you have seen in the video in itself right?,agent
105,43:19:00,So your expert can create a short video and send it to you to explain explaining you that particular doubt.,agent
105,43:25:00,So we have this forum within each of the questions where you can actually get it resolved option based itself.,agent
105,43:30:00,Yeah.,agent
105,43:33:00,OK then I think I am good.,prospect
105,43:36:00,All right so lets connect probably Friday and get it started.,agent
105,43:40:00,I will message you next Friday.,prospect
105,43:42:00,"All right, take care then.",agent
105,43:45:00,See you.,agent
105,43:46:00,Thank you.,prospect
105,43:47:00,Bye.,agent
105,43:47:00,"Bye, bye, bye.",agent
1,00:44,"Hey Nikita, yes, hey, Hi Amruth, hey, hi again.",Agent
1,00:50,Happy New year And I assume that the set of concerns which and Nivesh has you know mentioned that that we need to address in the call.,Agent
1,00:59,Its the same for you as well.,Agent
1,01:00,Nikita.,Agent
1,01:01,"Yes, yes.",Prospect
1,01:04,"All right, perfect.",Agent
1,01:05,"So Nikita, before we start, help me with the mail ID in the chat.",Agent
1,01:12,"Sorry your voice is breaking a little, Amrit.",Prospect
1,01:15,"Yeah, even I can.",Prospect
1,01:18,Ohh.,Agent
1,01:18,Is it?,Agent
1,01:19,Yeah.,Prospect
1,01:21,Just just let me know.,Agent
1,01:24,Just just give me a second.,Prospect
1,01:30,Just give me one second.,Prospect
1,01:31,Let me try to connect with a different device.,Prospect
1,01:35,Just give me one second.,Prospect
1,01:37,"Yeah, sure, sure.",Agent
1,03:05,Hello.,Prospect
1,03:07,"Yes, Amruth.",Prospect
1,03:10,"Yeah, not sure.",Agent
1,03:12,"Usually I just connect, you know, I just connect with that device, which generally works well.",Agent
1,03:18,Give me a second.,Agent
1,03:21,"Actually, it is much clearer now.",Prospect
1,03:26,Is it?,Agent
1,03:28,I had the voice earlier.,Prospect
1,03:29,I was using Bluetooth.,Prospect
1,03:32,What about?,Prospect
1,03:32,"No, no, no.",Prospect
1,03:32,"It is gone, completely gone, so on.",Prospect
1,03:39,"So basically, I have turned to speaker mode.",Agent
1,03:44,Is this fine?,Agent
1,03:46,"Yeah, it is fine now.",Prospect
1,03:48,"Yeah, it is fine.",Prospect
1,03:50,"All right, All right.",Agent
1,03:50,"In that case, So what I was telling is I, I require a your mail ID.",Agent
1,04:01,"Nikita, you can just bring me a mail ID here in the chat.",Agent
1,04:05,"Yeah, yeah, done.",Prospect
1,04:21,"Alright, perfect.",Agent
1,04:22,"So to address your questions one by one, do you wish to see the portal and have a you know real ID?",Agent
1,04:33,Because the first point animation that you have mentioned is course extension.,Agent
1,04:37,So what do you mean by course extension animation?,Agent
1,04:40,What what what exactly were you referring to?,Agent
1,04:43,Yes.,Prospect
1,04:44,So basically course extension as in let us say I buy 2 month course and after after 2 months let us say I feel that my preparation is not enough and if I want to extend the course so that is the case.,Prospect
1,05:00,So for that I mailed Sandeep and then he asked me to get on the call with you.,Prospect
1,05:05,And so I wanted to understand that thing.,Prospect
1,05:08,"So currently, do you have a valid account or is it that you're planning to start and you're looking from a future standpoint?",Agent
1,05:16,I'm looking from a future standpoint.,Prospect
1,05:18,"And OK, so to extend to extend, what you need is, you know, for for one month, you'd have to pay an extra of $89 per month.",Agent
1,05:28,So when is it?,Agent
1,05:30,"See, I just want to understand from each of you, you know, you just starting, you are just starting your preparation, you know, have you taken any mock or anything so far  Nikita, not yet.",Agent
1,05:42,"OK, OK.",Agent
1,05:43,"So do you have any deadlines in, in terms of when you have to apply to schools and when do you when you have to have that score in hand?",Agent
1,05:53,So basically I am planning for spring index.,Prospect
1,05:55,"So deadline is around March, April, OK, close to close to 3 months time, right.",Prospect
1,06:02,"And is that, is that the same case for Nikita?",Agent
1,06:06,Not as often round.,Prospect
1,06:07,I mean I am just starting to prepare for it.,Prospect
1,06:10,"And yeah, there is no hard deadline for me at least.",Prospect
1,06:15,"All right, got it, got it.",Agent
1,06:16,She is looking for next to next like 2027 it takes.,Agent
1,06:20,So she is got much more time then.,Agent
1,06:22,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Prospect
1,06:24,Got it.,Agent
1,06:24,"So see in, in, in either ways, either ways getting a GMAT score, maybe animation you you'd realise, right.",Agent
1,06:31,"So, so if you, if you had look for spring intake and if you had done your GMAT previous year itself, that would have been great.",Agent
1,06:38,"So that, that's one of the reasons I guess you would have recommended Nikita because it's always better to start early and get done with the GMAT early so that we have that Peace of Mind because it's gonna be active for 5 years.",Agent
1,06:48,"So we can comfortably apply during the scheduled time and that we can, we can go for it.",Agent
1,06:54,"So, so, so that's one thing regarding your extension part and Himesh, every month extension would cost you 89 on top of that.",Agent
1,07:05,"So that's, that's how the pricing goes.",Agent
1,07:10,"So is that, is that something which you wanted to know?",Agent
1,07:13,"And and when you extend it of course you are gonna continue with the same you know, account duration and all these things.",Agent
1,07:20,"So yeah, so Amrit, another thing is so I have got a mail from Sandeep that lets say I if I if I buy today within 2048 hours, so then he is going to allow me to pay the difference amount and extend the course see for 3 months.",Prospect
1,07:42,"There is to be to be honest, I will tell you if if you are looking for a 4 month standpoint that's different see for for 3 months paying the difference in the sense what was communicated to you not, not not 3 months like 4 months.",Agent
1,07:54,"So you have got 3 slabs, right, 2 months, 4 months and 6 months.",Agent
1,08:00,"Yeah, right.",Prospect
1,08:02,"So if I want to extend for 4 months, he said you can pay the difference amount and then I will allow you to get enroll for 4 months.",Prospect
1,08:12,Yeah.,Agent
1,08:12,"So that would be see I, I will tell you in that case what he would have meant is see we are you know the, the 4 months course would be priced at 2:00 $99 like $299 4 months course and 2 months course is priced at 1:00 $99.",Agent
1,08:31,And we are also running some discounts at the moment.,Agent
1,08:33,So it will be 159.,Agent
1,08:36,"So I, I will check back and come come to you on what was communicated because if you if you look at from the different standpoint.",Agent
1,08:44,"So if you are getting at a, it will be 159, right.",Agent
1,08:49,"And then if you have to pay 299 anyways, it's gonna cost you the same.",Agent
1,08:53,"And if you're directly purchasing 4 months, you have that with a discounted price right now for 249.",Agent
1,09:00,So that is one one aspect that is what my query is.,Prospect
1,09:05,"So that was very unclear there and that's why I wanted to get on call with you so I can so if you want, I can send you the screenshot mail for your.",Prospect
1,09:14,Can you just share share your screen to me?,Agent
1,09:16,Can you just share your screen to me?,Agent
1,09:17,"yeah okay, can you now?",Prospect
1,09:34,"Yeah I can I can see your screen yeah, I can see your screen.",Agent
1,09:39,"So not this, yeah, this is so I had this query regarding the course, course extension.",Prospect
1,09:50,OK.,Agent
1,09:51,Then I got this mail from Sandeep from GMAT.,Prospect
1,09:55,You can verify the email again.,Prospect
1,09:57,Sandeep is my colleague.,Agent
1,09:58,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",Prospect
1,10:00,"So he said Ki, thank you for writing.",Prospect
1,10:02,"And like you said, you are going to charge $89.",Prospect
1,10:06,"How where to make your decision easier and to encourage your start right away, I can do the following for you.",Prospect
1,10:13,"As an exception, if you are ready to start in next 48 hours, I can secure an approval to offer the following exclusive offer for you.",Prospect
1,10:20,"You can purchase 2 month course as of now in 30 days of first purchase, you can anytime pay the difference in price and upgrade to the 4 months course.",Prospect
1,10:27,"Yeah, so this would be over here.",Prospect
1,10:34,So So what you wanted is also regarding this discounted price only right So what you wanted was to pay 159 now and get that discounted price of 249 as a difference.,Agent
1,10:44,that's what you wanted right Yeah yeah like yeah yeah.,Prospect
1,10:48,"So you can you can get that, but the contingencies is clear.",Agent
1,10:52,You know you have to you know reach out to us and you know you know get it done within 30 days.,Agent
1,10:58,So so this is just for you to get it started.,Agent
1,11:02,"Suppose if so, so the reason why it is being mentioned is even though you just for the sake of money, let's not, you know, hold on to our preparation is what exactly it meant.",Agent
1,11:15,"So the idea behind this message for you is to, you know, make it clear because of this confusion regarding you know which to go by.",Agent
1,11:24,Let's not waste time.,Agent
1,11:25,So you know the reason why something had mentioned is because if you if you are confused between starting 2 months and 4 months and that's what is keeping you delayed.,Agent
1,11:34,Let's not wait for that.,Agent
1,11:35,Let let us make it easier for you.,Agent
1,11:38,What you can do is you can pay for 2 months if that's that's what you're looking at pay for 2 months and you'll have 30 days to decide if if you have to go for 4 months or just continue with 2 months.,Agent
1,11:50,"So you'll have that option if you wish to continue for 4 months within 30 days, you'd have a very clear idea in terms of if you would want to extend it for 4 months or not.",Agent
1,11:58,"And if you don't want to extend for 4 months, of course you'd have this for 19.",Agent
1,12:03,"So the message is clear, you, you're for 249.",Agent
1,12:06,So you'll have to pay the difference from 249 to 159.,Agent
1,12:10,You can pay the difference within 30 days of time.,Agent
1,12:12,"That that, that that part is, you know, clear right.",Agent
1,12:16,Animation.,Agent
1,12:17,"OK, So that 4 month price will be 249 only.",Prospect
1,12:19,"So that will be just like, yeah, yeah.",Agent
1,12:22,"So that that's what you enquire also about, right?",Agent
1,12:24,Because if it is you know $299 it doesn't make sense because any which is you know it will not make sense.,Agent
1,12:30,"So you replied with the help of this you know discount coupon which is there, you were confused.",Agent
1,12:38,We did not go for 2 months discounted price or 4 months discounted price.,Agent
1,12:41,"And you, you are in that dilemma and to help you out for a better situation, to put you in a better situation, we have given you that offer which you can think about and come back.",Agent
1,12:52,OK.,Prospect
1,12:52,And similar it is for 6 months as well right or what 6 months also.,Prospect
1,12:57,But yeah within 30 days you will have to you know confirm.,Agent
1,13:00,"OK, yeah that that's it.",Prospect
1,13:02,Either way.,Prospect
1,13:02,"Either way, maybe, maybe you can reply on that mail with the same thing with the discounted price because I have got another from Jessica as well about the prices that I have recently replied to her as well about this is the price.",Prospect
1,13:21,These are the prices currently as of now.,Agent
1,13:24,"Yeah, yeah.",Agent
1,13:24,"See, see, we so, so this is a standard pricing or discounted pricing which is there.",Agent
1,13:30,"So even even for, you know, all, all the students, it will be the standard pricing of 159 to 499319.",Agent
1,13:37,That's a discounted pricing which is there.,Agent
1,13:40,"So whatever we discussed, you have reverted on, on, on this, right?",Agent
1,13:44,This is what you referred to.,Agent
1,13:45,"So, so so you can decide.",Agent
1,13:48,So we will have 30 days to decide if to go for 4 months paying the difference or 6 months paying the difference or not to you know if 2 months is enough for you.,Agent
1,13:58,"Yeah, yeah, but there but if you want to extend it for say 3 months, if that's or 15 days, we also have 15 days extension.",Agent
1,14:07,"We just need to pay $49 in that case you don't have to after around 30 days when it is around 25 plus days, you can decide if to extend for 15 days.",Agent
1,14:16,Is that your your priority after because you have time till you know 2 months anyways you are going to purchase for 2 months.,Agent
1,14:23,So you will have a clarity within 25 days how how it is progressing.,Agent
1,14:27,"And if you think that 15 days is enough, you can actually towards the end of end of 2 months you can actually purchase 15 days extension for $49 or $89 for one month extension.",Agent
1,14:38,You can do that.,Agent
1,14:39,"But if you are, if you want to go for 4 months, you can pay the difference.",Agent
1,14:41,"And so which is around $90 again, $89 for the same $89 that you are paying extra, you are going to get 2 months.",Agent
1,14:48,"That's the difference, right?",Agent
1,14:49,So you're gonna get that.,Agent
1,14:51,"Maybe you can, yeah, maybe you can reply on that mail and confirm that you, you revert to just, I'm not in the loop, right?",Agent
1,14:59,"First, first you include me in the loop, then I'll revert to you.",Agent
1,15:03,"If you can just reply on the mail with me in or addressing me keeping the same people in CC or the records and you can tell that as discussed, you know whenever you are planning to purchase, you can tell that as discussed, I would be paying 2 months now and I would like to within 30 days I will revert on the extended duration.",Agent
1,15:27,"If it is 4 months or 6 months which I want to go, I will pay that difference with the offer amount and you know we can mention 249 and 319.",Agent
1,15:35,So just keep me also in loop.,Agent
1,15:38,"Yeah, so I have a clarity.",Agent
1,15:42,Is this your this thing dot com?,Agent
1,15:45,"Yeah, you can.",Prospect
1,15:46,This is my mail.,Prospect
1,15:48,So does it work and you can just put it forward and continue with that.,Prospect
1,15:53,"That is one thing and see if hypothetically, you know, you just wanted to understand from Nikita's end, you would Nikita, when are you planning to start?",Agent
1,16:05,"See one, one more thing which I would like to tell you is if Nikita and animation, if you are both planning to start on the same day or purchasing on the same day, we can actually give you some extension of 15 days or something for free.",Agent
1,16:19,"You don't even have to pay for it if, if that's the case.",Agent
1,16:22,"So because we consider that as a referral kind of thing and out of courtesy, we do that.",Agent
1,16:27,"If if that's something which you are looking at and you know, let that not be the only driving factor.",Agent
1,16:32,"But but of course, if you would like to see the course and all these things, I can quickly give you a view of that as well for you, for each of you.",Agent
1,16:40,"But yeah, so if both of you are purchasing on the same day for each of you, Nikita as well as animation will give you a 15 days extension which is worth $49.",Agent
1,16:51,That too would be added towards the end of you know of your 2 months journey.,Agent
1,16:56,"Whichever course you are purchasing be 2 months, 4 months or 6 months you are going to have we will give you an extension of 15 days you know out of courtesy so that that we can think of if if you're purchasing on the same day OK now actually I will let you know about that because I'm I'm at very beginners stage right now right right.",Prospect
1,17:19,Yeah.,Prospect
1,17:20,"So I'm still in deciding zone and once I once I go through because you have time right Yeah Nikita, I understand you have time.",Agent
1,17:28,"So just just letting you know on on this element, but you know, it's completely on you anyways, you know, but that's not the main point.",Agent
1,17:38,"So I'll just share my screen and just quickly show you as well on in terms of, you know, how the course would be laid out and all these things.",Agent
1,17:47,"And, you know, first of all, each of you would ask both of you to, you know, start with the test.",Agent
1,17:54,So it's very important.,Agent
1,17:55,You don't have to be prepared.,Agent
1,17:57,"You don't have to have a, you know, brush up.",Agent
1,17:59,"You don't have to go through all those things, but you know, the first thing that we'd recommend is to take up a test to understand what about GMAT.",Agent
1,18:06,"You'll have getting started videos where you understand what you know how the GMAT scoring works, how to you know how the e GMAT learning architecture works.",Agent
1,18:13,All these things you're gonna cover about the tests.,Agent
1,18:15,"Also, you're gonna have a clarity.",Agent
1,18:17,So animation.,Prospect
1,18:17,"Nikita, I hope each of you are aware about the GMAT scoring patterns and the, the you know, the elements are you, No, no, no, we are so yeah.",Prospect
1,18:29,"So GMAT you know, we earlier had a classic edition and now we have something called Focus Edition and we had a couple of things which is being removed.",Agent
1,18:40,And in Focus edition we have few things which added.,Agent
1,18:42,"So you know, in in classic edition we had only verbal and quant section, only 2 sections where in quants you had, you know, geometry which is now removed in the Focus edition.",agent
1,18:54,"In vowel you would had you had sentence correction, analytical writing kind of things which is also removed and a new section is added called data insights and this is section which is is being added as new.",agent
1,19:09,So.,agent
1,19:11,"So right now we have 3 sections 45 minutes each for each of the sessions and you will have 23 questions on verbal, 21 questions in quants and 20 questions in data insights.",agent
1,19:23,That is how the question layout happens.,agent
1,19:25,"And each, each you know, section has a scores, you know, score set ranging from 60 to 90.",agent
1,19:32,"That is verbal 60 to verbal 90, quant 60 to quant 90.",agent
1,19:35,That is Q 60 to Q 90 and D 60 to D 90.,agent
1,19:38,That's what the scoring range or the spectrum of scores that you can get.,agent
1,19:42,That's a scale score.,agent
1,19:43,"We call it scale score that determines your, your total score.",agent
1,19:47,So the the scoring of GMAT starts from 205 to 805205 being the lowest and 805 being the perfect score.,agent
1,19:56,So that's how it is.,agent
1,19:57,And what are the schools that each of you are targeting?,agent
1,20:01,Can you just help me with once more?,agent
1,20:02,And do you have any idea of what should be the scores that you need to chase?,agent
1,20:08,Yeah around 635.,prospect
1,20:10,I am planning for some top BB schools.,prospect
1,20:14,"So my target score, when I spoke with MB&B and and some of other consultancies, they said yeah, I need to be scoring around 685 and all.",prospect
1,20:25,"Yeah, 685 would be 96 percentile, Nikita.",agent
1,20:28,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",prospect
1,20:30,That's that's for the top B schools.,prospect
1,20:33,We have to have at least 685 around.,prospect
1,20:36,Yeah.,prospect
1,20:37,"So if you are looking for, you know, schools outside India, of course you would have to go beyond that.",agent
1,20:42,"If you are looking for say Harvard, Stanford or you know NCR, all the schools maybe based on your profile, 685 would be a competence score, but something about 700 7 not 5 would be ideal.",agent
1,20:54,Like around 98 percentile would be helping you get a kind of scholarships and other things If you are looking for that that would do.,agent
1,21:00,"But if you are looking for Indian schools like NCR or London Business School for these schools, the median range is 655 is a median score, but we have to have 20 to 30 point improvement for those schools.",agent
1,21:10,"If you are looking for London Business School or beat, you know Indian School of Business, ISB Hyderabad or for for these schools, a score of 685695 would do.",agent
1,21:20,"And even the round one application which is happening in this September for ISVCISV saw schools, you know, ISV offers even up to 100% scholarships.",agent
1,21:31,Most schools does most of the top schools offers up to 100% scholarships in the round one and subsequent rounds you would see a decline in the scholarship percentage.,agent
1,21:41,So ideally we should be looking for getting those scholarships in place with a really high GMAT score.,agent
1,21:46,"That's that's something which you need to target and to get a 685, you have to have an average of 848484 each in your quants verbal and data inside section a score of 848484 on an average.",agent
1,21:59,That is what you need to chase.,agent
1,22:01,That is your magical number.,agent
1,22:02,"If your target is 685, your magical number is 252.",agent
1,22:07,That is 848484.,agent
1,22:08,That can come in any combination.,agent
1,22:10,"If if hypothetically verbal and you know in quants you have 84 in verbal you have you know only 80 or you know in data instance you have only 80, quant you have 84.",agent
1,22:22,So in verbal you have to go to 88 to make sure that you are getting that 252 as a sum of scores and you have to get A25021 way or the other any based on any combination.,agent
1,22:33,"And to get there is what you know, we would create this study plan.",agent
1,22:38,So based on your initial targets.,agent
1,22:40,So that's why we ask you to first take a test without any preparation where what exactly are you in in the raw form to understand what exactly is your position and accordingly create a study plan.,agent
1,22:50,"Suppose most of the students do this mistake, they will think that OK, let me do a revision on my own and then we will come back and take a course.",agent
1,22:57,It is not actually required because the course in itself is going to cover from the fundamentals.,agent
1,23:01,"If we see for verbal, we have only critical reasoning and reading comprehension as the main section.",agent
1,23:06,"But we have something called master comprehension which covers your fundamentals, which is actually going to build a strong fundamentals for your verbal and and similarly for quants.",agent
1,23:15,"If you look at we have all the main sections, arithmetic and algebra.",agent
1,23:18,"Arithmetic would be comprising of number of properties, portfolios, advanced topics and algebra is the another section.",agent
1,23:23,But before that we have quant basics.,agent
1,23:25,So technically you don't require any prerequisites you know to to start your preparation.,agent
1,23:31,That's how the course in itself is designed.,agent
1,23:33,"But the another aspect is you know, within the course, the, the within the platform in itself, you are actually going to get feedback every 30 minutes within the platform if you are going, you know, doing things in the right way or, or you are getting derailed from the actual study.",agent
1,23:48,"So we have this algorithm which helps you understand in real time every 30 minutes if you are, you know, preparing in the right direction.",agent
1,23:57,And you will also have mentor support animation Nikita.,agent
1,24:02:00,"So mentor support is from day one, you would be a mentor would be assigned animation.",agent
1,24:06:00,"If you are purchasing say today, within 24 hours, a mentor would be assigned to you.",agent
1,24:10:00,It will be a dedicated mentor from day one till you are tested.,agent
1,24:12:00,"So what they will be doing is they, they would be, you know, giving you, you know, the first during the first connects you, you, you, you are going to get a certain set of task.",agent
1,24:22:00,"You are going to do those tasks and come back and they are going to evaluate it and you know, they, they are going to give you feedback and then you are going to go to the next set of task.",agent
1,24:29:00,"So, so you would be getting on a chain of communication from that point of time.",agent
1,24:33:00,"And and Himesh, I am going to send you in WhatsApp a detailed video regarding what the mentor support is.",agent
1,24:40:00,Who could could you could you just share it with Nikita as well for her to understand?,agent
1,24:45:00,Sure.,agent
1,24:45:00,If I send it to you.,agent
1,24:46:00,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
1,24:48:00,So that would cover you a great idea in terms of what covers in the mentor support and how your mentor support is actually going to help you in terms of your prep.,agent
1,24:57:00,So you know that that that is that is one one aspect.,agent
1,25:01:00,"And you know what, what else the are we planning to discuss today?",agent
1,25:11:00,And one more thing regarding the feedbacks and all these things.,agent
1,25:13:00,If you could see if you look at say critical reasoning.,agent
1,25:16:00,"So there are a lot of, you know, elements within it.",agent
1,25:19:00,"So each of the files that you see the, the learning modules would have first conceptual videos, then application videos to ensure that you are applying the concepts or techniques.",agent
1,25:27:00,We call it can call it tips and tricks or all these things that you learn in in real GMAT questions and understand if you are able to apply those without worrying about time that is application files.,agent
1,25:37:00,Then we look at the time space in a practice quiz mode in terms of each type of question.,agent
1,25:41:00,"Once each type of questions are done, we are stage one is done.",agent
1,25:44:00,"So once your stage one is done, see we will have a starting score.",agent
1,25:47:00,We have a target score.,agent
1,25:48:00,We have to get to that score.,agent
1,25:49:00,It does not happen overnight.,agent
1,25:51:00,Your learning is going to be progressive and it is very important that you track.,agent
1,25:54:00,"Trackability is one of the things that you have to understand because when you take up a course for say 4 months or 6 months or 2 months, it is not just the money commitment that you are doing, it's also the time commitment that you are involved in.",agent
1,26:07:00,"So that's one one of the biggest you know, you know, you know, commitments that you give and it has to be utilised in the right way and you have to have a clear understanding if it is helping you, is it are you improving?",agent
1,26:18:00,"You know, just sitting and working on it blindly for situation, then realising that I'm nowhere is too devastating.",agent
1,26:25:00,So what we have to understand and our course in itself is designed is to give you feedbacks and help you understand as you cross each milestone in terms of your scores and you thereby know from which code to which code you are progressing.,agent
1,26:37:00,"Suppose if you are starting with 4 hundreds, you, you know when you reach 450, then you when you reach 5 hundreds, 556 hundreds, you are going to have a clarity.",agent
1,26:47:00,"And that would put in a really good position in terms of understanding your progressing and also give you that confidence that OK, you are going in the right track without without getting debated.",agent
1,26:55:00,And that's why you have a mentor also.,agent
1,26:57:00,"So would to to have give that kind of a clarity, you'll also have a calendar view.",agent
1,27:02:00,"Of course, even though mentor support is there, you're going to have a calendar view to understand in terms of what activities have to be done on a daily basis.",agent
1,27:08:00,And on a weekly basis.,agent
1,27:10:00,You also have this time commitment calendar where you can always come and adjust.,agent
1,27:14:00,"And if any of the particularity you committed say 2 hours or 3 hours and you couldn't show up for that particularity, you can come and mark it as a no study day.",agent
1,27:21:00,So that your mentor would also have a clarity that that particular day you are not able to study.,agent
1,27:25:00,"If in case you you are able to study only one hour, you're going to come and mark it as one hour.",agent
1,27:30:00,"Or if if that turned out to be a holiday, you were able to put 6 hours of prep, you're going to do that as well.",agent
1,27:34:00,So accordingly a calendar and schedule would adjust itself.,agent
1,27:38:00,"That makes it really, you know, convenient in terms of managing your prep.",agent
1,27:43:00,"And, and next element is for each of the files, you are going to have a grading system where you are going to compare yourself to your peers and the global population.",agent
1,27:51:00,"So we are going to compare for each of the files that you take, you know, how well you are doing compared to your peers in the global population.",agent
1,27:58:00,What's the median first item score and what's your first item score?,agent
1,28:01:00,"Accordingly, you are going to get a grade and these grades does not require, again like the way I said, you don't require any pre, you know, information to get a high score because we are going to test you only on things that we teach.",agent
1,28:13:00,So of course we are going to teach from the fundamentals.,agent
1,28:15:00,Someone who is already strong.,agent
1,28:17:00,"Suppose if hypothetically, if animation is, you know really strong in the fundamentals and and as well as the code thing verbally is a very strong area for  may not be for Nikita or either you know vice versa.",agent
1,28:29:00,"So in in either of the scenario, the what what happens is animation would go through things faster.",agent
1,28:36:00,There there not be any difference in grades.,agent
1,28:38:00,If both of you are doing the course really well.,agent
1,28:40:00,"What you would realise is you you would be skimming animal should be skimming through things faster with grade is throughout Nikita you take more time in in understanding grasping things and then going by and getting grade you might take a bit more time than him that that is the that is going to be the difference majorly and based on the aggregate grades here you see level zero, level one, level 2, Level 3 grades as you progress.",agent
1,29:04:00,"Suppose if it is CR from 28 percentile once you complete your video, you know the lessons that you complete.",agent
1,29:10:00,Once you finish that you are going to realise that you would be in a spectrum between 48 percentile to around 78 percentile.,agent
1,29:15:00,So what determines which towards which side are you?,agent
1,29:19:00,Are you towards that lower end of the spectrum or higher end of the spectrum is based on your grades.,agent
1,29:23:00,So you get a clear cut clarity from your mentor in terms of what exactly are your current percentile levels.,agent
1,29:29:00,"And if you are getting a 70 percentile during the course, if you are consistently getting all grade is that is an indicator that you have the quality of learning that you have done in stage one is you know really good.",agent
1,29:41:00,"And once once we do that, just just give me a second.",agent
1,29:43:00,It is just malfunctioning.,agent
1,29:46:00,"Yeah, Amrit, it's I see the platform is very comprehensive.",prospect
1,29:51:00,It's very good.,prospect
1,29:52:00,"But I see so there will be that mentor assigned to us, right.",prospect
1,29:58:00,"To show what to use and how to use this platform, right.",prospect
1,30:02:00,"This is no, it's not for how to use the platform.",agent
1,30:05:00,See mentor support is not for that.,agent
1,30:08:00,"It's much beyond it's they, they are gonna be the complete, you know, instructor or the guide for your complete GMAT journey.",agent
1,30:15:00,And those are the people see our platform.,agent
1,30:17:00,"If if you are purchasing a course, I always tell my student that you are paying only around 60 to 70% for your platform and the course and the quizzes, all this practice quizzes or whatever it is that you see not here you are going to have a separate platform for practice in Ch 2 where you are going to have your track, your improvements and all the things you are going to do.",agent
1,30:36:00,So all those I would still say is maximum 70% is your weightage and 30% is the mental support.,agent
1,30:44:00,"And you have to actually, you know, make sure that you are utilising it to your full list.",agent
1,30:48:00,"And towards the end of your prepsi, the the main aspect or the main the game of your menta is initially when when you connect with them and, and you when you have a communication with them and all these things, you are going to get a clear instruction.",agent
1,31:02:00,"When, especially when you are at a 635 or lesser, you're going to get a very clear instruction in terms of what to do and how to do and all this since you're going to get a clarity.",agent
1,31:09:00,"But within the platform itself, you will see that we have, we capture a lot of data points, data information, your average correct time, incorrect time, your accuracy, your behavioral patterns.",agent
1,31:18:00,"We capture a lot of data with which once you reach a 635, we will be able to enroll you in a program called Last Mile Push that is 2 data intensive.",agent
1,31:28:00,"And you know, see the difference between someone, if I take 2 people, person A and person B1 is at 6:35, one is at 7:35.",agent
1,31:35:00,"The difference between both of the people, if I, if I give them a GMAT test and give them 10 hours to do, both of them would have a same kind of accuracy there, their scores would be marginally different.",agent
1,31:45:00,So there will be very less margin of their difference in scores.,agent
1,31:48:00,"The reason is because once you reach a 635, there will not be anything further that you can actually learn or see a video or listen to any lecture and going to improve.",agent
1,31:58:00,"It's, it's not going to happen.",agent
1,31:59:00,"You have to have a personalised you know structure and you have to identify your strengths, weakness and then do a fine tuning and improve on your timing.",agent
1,32:07:00,"So beyond 635 it is all about the timing game, not about the conceptual clarity all all this things.",agent
1,32:13:00,So you will have to require a lot of fine tuning for which we enrolled in last mile push program and all this things that details of which I would be sending it to you.,agent
1,32:20:00,So the main aspect is you are not going to pay for anything else you know after your first payment point.,agent
1,32:26:00,After that there is no other purchase that you have to do within the course to get all this all done in 2 months.,agent
1,32:32:00,Only that last mile push and everything.,agent
1,32:34:00,"See to to be honest , I'll tell you.",agent
1,32:37:00,"Suppose if you are you know, the first second diagnostic vision, all these things.",agent
1,32:41:00,"And if your score is say already at A575585 and you have you know, at least 25 hours to give on a weekly basis preparation 2 months would do for you to get a 685.",agent
1,32:52:00,But it's it's subjective.,agent
1,32:54:00,"If you are not getting say 575580 5:00 in the test that you take instead you are getting say 515 or 495, then 2 months might not be enough.",agent
1,33:03:00,"You have to go for 4 months of prep and there are students who can give a maximum who's who's having a very high working schedule, very hectic working schedule, would eventually have only 15 hours of work time and they are currently at say around 4 50s.",agent
1,33:17:00,They recommend them to take 6 months and anything more than 6 months.,agent
1,33:21:00,"If you are taking for your preparation, that means that you are doing it wrong because GMAT is a kind of test which has a very defined syllabus, defined type of questions.",agent
1,33:29:00,"Indeed, if you look at say critical listening, you are going to get questions only from these type of questions.",agent
1,33:34:00,"Within critical reason we have only 9 types, inference, assumption, evaluate, strengthen, weaken, boldface.",agent
1,33:39:00,"In miscellaneous you have around 3 types, FIB, flop, paradox.",agent
1,33:43:00,These are your only type of cases that can ever come in a test.,agent
1,33:46:00,So the the key is in mastering each type of question unlike cat or other test.,agent
1,33:51:00,This is the biggest advantage that you would have with GMAT because you have very definite type of questions and very different type of questions which can come in a test.,agent
1,34:00:00,So it is about learning the right technique for each type of question and for that how many hours that you have to give within the course.,agent
1,34:07:00,"You are going to have a very clear clarity as well on how long within verbal, how many hours you have to give within months, how many hours have you have to give within data and says how many hours you have to give and you are going to have a tentative GMAT test date as well.",agent
1,34:20:00,So animation all this things would help you understand if this time is enough.,agent
1,34:25:00,So you like the way we said if you are purchasing for 2 months within day one you are going to do this you know and create a study plan within one day itself.,agent
1,34:34:00,So within day one you would realise how long you are going to take for your prep.,agent
1,34:38:00,"So you know, just for paying the difference.",agent
1,34:40:00,You do not even require 30 days.,agent
1,34:42:00,You are going to have the scores captured within the within the you know algorithm.,agent
1,34:47:00,You are going to put your you know time commitments accordingly.,agent
1,34:50:00,You are going to have a fair estimate what exactly or how many hours you are going to take exactly to get to what kind of scores.,agent
1,34:59:00,"Another thing is some yeah, please go ahead.",agent
1,35:03:00,"Yeah, yeah, go ahead Nikita.",agent
1,35:05:00,Yeah.,agent
1,35:06:00,"So all these practice questions, those that are provided on your platform, Amrit, are these designs specifically by e GMAT or do you also refer this OG that is provided by GMAC?",prospect
1,35:21:00,"You are asking about the question quality or just just to be clear, the, the level and the, the difficulty.",agent
1,35:30:00,See that is see see the difficulty level.,agent
1,35:32:00,"See one thing which is very, very particular is the course in itself.",agent
1,35:36:00,The easy mat platform is built on top of the quality of questions.,agent
1,35:40:00,"So any, any program for the GMAT, a platform has to be built in terms of the quality of questions that has to be there and it has to resonate exactly with what you would find in your GMAT.",agent
1,35:52:00,"If you look at say hard questions, easy questions, medium questions, a medium question should be of medium difficulty level of your GMAT and hard questions.",agent
1,35:59:00,"And see these questions are also designed by, you know, people only, right?",agent
1,36:02:00,"So the within EZMAT you would find if you just check the GMAT club, you would realise that that the within the top 5 instructors out there, you would find 3 people or the top 3 instructors rated in GMAT club are from EZMAT.",agent
1,36:18:00,"So, you know, the quality of questions that we make and and give are really close to your, you know, the the actual thing.",agent
1,36:25:00,"And that is one of the reasons why most of the students that did see within our platform, most of the people who have got 695685.",agent
1,36:33:00,"Can you just see here all the people, all the people who just checkout their videos, their difference in scores from their actual final mock within our platform.",agent
1,36:43:00,"And the actual test is plus or -10 that that kind of accuracy is possible because of the quality of questions which is in place and the algorithm which, you know, generates this adaptive questions.",agent
1,36:54:00,So is that your question Nikita?,agent
1,36:56:00,Just just checking.,agent
1,36:59:00,"Yeah, yeah, I, I just wanted to check if the these are specifically designed by EG MAT or the its a mixture of EG MAT questions and what questions are over there in, in the official guide.",prospect
1,37:14:00,"No, the, the these are specifically designed by by us.",agent
1,37:18:00,But here you can still find medium cementing OG quizzes.,agent
1,37:21:00,Can you see this?,agent
1,37:23:00,"Yeah, you can see medium cementing OG quizzes.",agent
1,37:25:00,"So wherever it is OG quizzes, we are going to mention that these are OG quizzes.",agent
1,37:29:00,"But this Caltranium is where we actually have built or you know, we have created our own questions and that requires a lot of R&D.",agent
1,37:36:00,"It's it's not that you know, we simply create questions and creating quality questions is really difficult.",agent
1,37:42:00,"So you know and that's why you see for GMAT the question pool, the quality question pools in the market in itself is very less so.",agent
1,37:51:00,"So wherever it is OG you are gonna find it as OG quiz mentioned here, hard, hard OG quizzes or medium OG quizzes, you are gonna particularly see that as OG quizzes.",agent
1,38:01:00,But it is not interlinked with the actual database.,agent
1,38:05:00,So those are different questions.,agent
1,38:06:00,So this would be different.,agent
1,38:07:00,What is the significance of that OG word that does it mean they are direct from the GMAT question bank or see they are very tough or what?,prospect
1,38:15:00,"See OG question banks are generally the questions which see when, when they create a question bank every, every, you know, they, they also do their R and they, they also create questions every year.",agent
1,38:27:00,"They, you know, create, you know, you know, at least around, you know, 1000 to 2000 questions.",agent
1,38:33:00,"The GMAC, GMAC, GMAC, yeah.",agent
1,38:36:00,So they also create around 1000 to 2000 questions.,agent
1,38:39:00,And every year they would use a certain portion of the questions for their actual GMAC test and they are actually going to keep the remaining questions which is there as O GS.,agent
1,38:50:00,So by default O GS are also a good quality questions.,agent
1,38:54:00,"And the questions which they have doubt for for instance, O GS are generally made of a question bank which they put out in public to understand the difficulty level.",agent
1,39:04:00,"So they would categorise wherever they have doubt regarding particular set of questions regarding the difficulty level, they would put out an OG based on their understanding.",agent
1,39:11:00,"So they get feedback from the experts the the the prep providers and all these things like from e GMAT, they are going to get a feedback in terms of how the questions are laid out.",agent
1,39:20:00,Is that question marked as medium is actually difficult.,agent
1,39:23:00,So they are going to get that feedback as well from the public because the GMAT questions in itself will not be revealed like they will not.,agent
1,39:31:00,"So that is why you would see maybe a score analysis or an ESR report will come, but you would never see the questions again.",agent
1,39:38:00,So like the question back that you are going to see in your test.,agent
1,39:42:00,"So that is why even in the test centre once you complete the test, you are never going to see those particular quizzes which you have attempt your questions you have attempted, you are never going to see that again.",agent
1,39:52:00,"OK, The reason is that so so OG questions are good enough but always some students make a mistake by purchasing OG in the starting and try to learn from OG.",agent
1,40:03:00,That is a very wrong approach because OG is not designed for your learning.,agent
1,40:07:00,It is.,agent
1,40:08:00,It is just.,agent
1,40:09:00,A set of question banks that you can practice towards the end of your prep.,agent
1,40:12:00,"Suppose if Manimesh or Nikita, what if even if you still want to purchase OG quizzes or you know OG question bank, 4 books are available if you would like to purchase it.",agent
1,40:23:00,"And if if you want to purchase it, you have to purchase and use it as a question bank to solve questions.",agent
1,40:28:00,Because the instructions are the you know step by step approach which they mentioned there to solve.,agent
1,40:32:00,And all these things are not very clear.,agent
1,40:34:00,It is not you know designed for learning.,agent
1,40:37:00,It is for you to just have a practice so you can purchase them.,agent
1,40:42:00,You can purchase them if you if you are looking at 23:24 OG quiz even I have the PDF versions within me and my system also.,agent
1,40:49:00,"So if if you had required, I can share you that maybe you can look into that because you you anyways, your test is gonna be on screen, right?",agent
1,40:57:00,Not necessarily you should purchase a book.,agent
1,41:00:00,So yeah.,agent
1,41:02:00,"So I can send you the PDF version of 2324 and after looking at that, after solving that, you can even look for 2425 question bank if you require you can purchase.",agent
1,41:12:00,So not necessarily jump on investments.,agent
1,41:16:00,"Yeah, OK.",prospect
1,41:17:00,"Another thing is let's say I will say my target score is 685, but let's say I I want to go beyond that.",prospect
1,41:25:00,So I hope it's not very it will not be cement concreted that no you you said 680 5:00 in the starting and that's what we are going to target now.,prospect
1,41:36:00,"Never, never, never don't even worry about that.",agent
1,41:40:00,Because see one thing is very clear.,agent
1,41:43:00,"If you give a certain 27 hours of time commitment and within 27 hours of time commitment that you have, you are starting from first of Jan, you are at a 325, you have to take 685, you are going to take at least 20, you are going to take around 25 of April.",agent
1,41:59:00,So listen to have plus or -3 to say plus or minus a week.,agent
1,42:03:00,"It can be +2020 5 + 1 week or 25 -, 1 week.",agent
1,42:08:00,"That's how your preparation, you know would differ because of the human factors and other factors involved.",agent
1,42:13:00,"But the key factor is we don't drift it and even even see if you if you get a 685, you purchase a course for say 6 months.",agent
1,42:21:00,"Within 4 months, you reach a 685.",agent
1,42:23:00,"Of course you should have this score for still improving it to 735, right?",agent
1,42:27:00,"Hypothetically, what a scenario comes in where you get more time.",agent
1,42:30:00,Your work became a bit easy.,agent
1,42:31:00,You are able to give more time and you are able to finish it and you should have that leverage to improve.,agent
1,42:36:00,So of course we would be happy to assist you if if you want to go for that.,agent
1,42:40:00,And even we recommend students.,agent
1,42:41:00,"Suppose if a student actually has to apply only on the the September month or you know the deadline is on September, the student actually gave the test or or is ready by February itself for a 685.",agent
1,42:54:00,"We recommend them that, you know, lets push for one more month and do it in March and make sure that we get A725735.",agent
1,43:02:00,"And that's why you would see most of the students, if you see you can actually reach out to them in LinkedIn, you would see the people with 725, at least 70% of the people who have got 7725.",agent
1,43:13:00,Even one of the students got 765.,agent
1,43:16:00,They eventually gave up when they had 685695.,agent
1,43:19:00,"They in a way halfway they gave up that OK, I, I, I think I have, I am ready for it.",agent
1,43:25:00,"We ourselves have pushed them that, you know, they have time they can improve and you know, get to that.",agent
1,43:30:00,So we ourself would push people for that.,agent
1,43:32:00,"And of course, if you yourself want to improve, why would we stop?",agent
1,43:39:00,"And there is this example that you took, right like of 224 score, you have to like distribute it like 8452, right?",prospect
1,43:50:00,252 be very clear.,prospect
1,43:54:00,So 252 is what you have to chase 224 would put you in that 30th percentile or 20th percentile will be somewhere around 4 hundreds or in the starting 500.,agent
1,44:03:00,"So yeah, 252 is your score.",agent
1,44:04:00,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",prospect
1,44:05:00,Amrit.,prospect
1,44:05:00,So another thing is how is this like 252?,prospect
1,44:09:00,"Then it's it will get scaled to what, 785685?",prospect
1,44:13:00,So how is this transition happening?,prospect
1,44:16:00,Can you explain that also?,prospect
1,44:18:00,"OK, so see the all the things you cannot find anywhere.",agent
1,44:21:00,"I'm just telling you, maybe you can take a note, see a score of 246 that is 828282 for for easy understanding.",agent
1,44:29:00,I am just telling you a score of 8282 for easy understanding.,agent
1,44:33:00,"You just think of this 82 on an average if you are getting that is added up to 246, right?",agent
1,44:39:00,Can you just add 80 to 8082?,agent
1,44:41:00,Its 246 right.,agent
1,44:42:00,So a 246 or 828282 on average is gonna give you 645.,agent
1,44:47:00,Just take a note.,agent
1,44:49:00,"I mean is just by default it is like that, is it?",prospect
1,44:52:00,It is default.,agent
1,44:53:00,"So for you to understand or for when you are targeting a different score, how this combination works?",agent
1,44:57:00,How do I know that say 246 is 645 and you know how do I know that 252 is 685 and how do I know that 255 is going to be 705?,agent
1,45:08:00,How do I know that?,agent
1,45:09:00,I am just giving you that insight.,agent
1,45:11:00,If you would like to do it yourself or understand yourself.,agent
1,45:13:00,One thing is as standard you can think of is the 246.,agent
1,45:18:00,A score of 246 that is 82 on an average is going to give you a score of 645.,agent
1,45:23:00,OK 645 is around 89th percentile is what you are going to get and that 645 is equivalent to 7 hundredths in the classic.,agent
1,45:31:00,So most of the schools which say 700 is their threshold that that is equivalent to 645 in classic.,agent
1,45:37:00,"So basically lets lets not complicate things but just just to make it clear, 82 on an average is going to give you you know 6 4583 on an average is gonna give you 66584 on an average is gonna give you 685 and 85 on an average is gonna give you 705.",agent
1,45:58:00,"So you see the pattern every average as your average increases by one in 828282838383, you're gonna see 20 point difference from 245 like from 645 to 665 to 685 to 705 to 725.",agent
1,46:15:00,"You're gonna see the difference, right?",agent
1,46:17:00,"You know, so that 20 point difference comes from your scores getting, you know, you know, 828282 then 838383 is 20, another 20 point difference you're gonna see with 848484 you're gonna see another 20 point difference.",agent
1,46:33:00,So that's how your scoring is gonna be.,agent
1,46:35:00,"So if you look at this particular scenario, 685 you, if you if you just add the target scores of verbal content DI 85 plus 86 + 8181.",agent
1,46:49:00,So this is 252.,agent
1,46:51:00,"If you just add 85 + 86 + 81, it is 252.",agent
1,46:55:00,"If you do 252 / 3, it's 84.",agent
1,46:59:00,Yeah.,prospect
1,47:00:00,So that's what I was telling.,agent
1,47:01:00,So that 848484 is coming because that 41 improvement.,agent
1,47:06:00,"So whichever target you have, how much percent is 9696 percentile 685 is 96 percentile original GMAT.",prospect
1,47:12:00,How much that will be in original GMAT you can do a plus 55 or plus 60.,agent
1,47:19:00,So it will be somewhere around 1160 around.,agent
1,47:23:00,"So it will be around if if you look at plus 55 in itself or plus 60 in itself, it is going to be around 74750.",agent
1,47:32:00,And is there any minimum number that we have to achieve in each section?,prospect
1,47:36:00,"No, there is no sectional cut off.",agent
1,47:37:00,"So that is a beauty even if you want to hit that, you know, that's what I was telling the combination score matters.",agent
1,47:43:00,"If it is 252, you can actually have 1990 in both.",agent
1,47:48:00,So it's 180 already.,agent
1,47:49:00,"So remaining you have to get 62, right?",agent
1,47:54:00,You can get even 62 and get a 242.,agent
1,47:57:00,"Like if it is 252, you have to get a 72 here.",agent
1,48:00:00,"So 1990 in each and 72 in data incest, which is actually less.",agent
1,48:04:00,"72 in data incest would be somewhere around, you know, 30th percentile that is actually less, but there is no sectional cut off does not matter.",agent
1,48:12:00,"OK, yeah, OK, OK.",prospect
1,48:17:00,Another thing is do you have any program like score guarantee like this guy Princeton Review and all those people have do you have something?,prospect
1,48:24:00,"Yeah, see even Princeton Review has TDB has Prince and review to an extent has and TDB also mentions in the website.",agent
1,48:31:00,But see one thing which is very clear is its its it's a gimmick to be to be precise.,agent
1,48:38:00,I will tell you why you can just go and see by yourself.,agent
1,48:42:00,"In most of the cases what is mentioned is lot of terms and conditions comes with, you know, score guarantee.",agent
1,48:47:00,"We can also provide the first thing mostly what they say is you have to have a valid GMAT score, not a mock score, not a, you know, not from their portal or not their thing.",agent
1,48:57:00,They want a valid GMAT score to start show as a starting point and within that.,agent
1,49:04:00,"So your score guarantee would be based on your starting score and to get it avail, they will say that you have to hit that particular percentile.",agent
1,49:12:00,"Suppose if you look at here, they would say that you have to hit those particular percentiles or threshold consistently or to make sure that each if if, if we hypothetically say that here in every course you have to get grade A if you get any of the less than grade A, you will not be availed.",agent
1,49:28:00,So how does it make sense because maybe there is also possibility that we had a bad day or something while preparing.,agent
1,49:33:00,Maybe we would come back and see.,agent
1,49:35:00,"But still you, you may not do well, but this is actually a good score.",agent
1,49:39:00,Like if you consider getting grade and maybe one grade A minus is perfectly fine.,agent
1,49:43:00,"But for giving conditions, they can give or we can even give a condition that it should be all grade A in throughout the course, you should be getting completely grade A so, so that by default you are going to be in that 70th percent as you finish it.",agent
1,49:55:00,And from that going it is easy.,agent
1,49:56:00,So we can put out an ideal situation in which you are bound to get that and then you know if that is not getting we can give you.,agent
1,50:04:00,So it is like you know tossing a coin and and you know you know 100 times and saying that if if you don't get tails even one time we are going to give you a refund.,agent
1,50:14:00,So you know you just have to think about it.,agent
1,50:16:00,"So, so those are claims just to attract.",agent
1,50:21:00,"If you just look at the terms and conditions carefully, you would realise that of course, would you, would you actually pay for a GMAT course right now and take it and, and then come back to them?",agent
1,50:31:00,"Because that in itself is gonna cost you like a course, right?",agent
1,50:34:00,"GMAT test in India, if you take, you're gonna have around 25,027, 1000 with, with, with taxes and all these things, you're gonna pay 27,000.",agent
1,50:43:00,"So are you actually gonna pay 27,000 and take the actual test and then come with a score to them and then you're gonna improve?",prospect
1,50:49:00,Is that the case?,prospect
1,50:51:00,"So, so you have to think about all this grounds and when when it comes to the score guarantee most of them would would recommend if you just go detail, you are going to see that they want a GMAT, actual GMAT score, not any of the mocks.",agent
1,51:03:00,They will not consider mocks at all.,agent
1,51:05:00,"So you have to have a GMAT score in place and then followed by the conditions that you have to do do these, these, these things and you have to ensure that you are hitting those only then they give you.",agent
1,51:15:00,"So why to get into all those things when actually, you know, we don't you know, we don't believe in doing all those things.",agent
1,51:22:00,"We say that see, if you do our course, we have proofs out there.",agent
1,51:26:00,"Now see if if it just each of the each of the platforms that you see, everybody has YouTube channel, all the test providers.",agent
1,51:32:00,You just have to check their name.,agent
1,51:33:00,Everybody has their channel.,agent
1,51:34:00,Just look at the success stories that they have posted in the last one month.,agent
1,51:38:00,"Just check the number of people who got maybe if your target is 685, just see how many 685 has been posted in the last one month.",agent
1,51:47:00,Check the do the counting as simple as that you would get your answer.,agent
1,51:52:00,And these are not just if you just see all this is just not testimonial video 5 minute or 2 minutes saying that Ezimat is the best.,agent
1,51:59:00,"No, we have this 25 minute video, 35 minute video, 2930 minutes.",agent
1,52:04:00,So all this way places where we are gonna discuss strategies as well.,agent
1,52:07:00,Of course they studied with us.,agent
1,52:09:00,That is one thing.,agent
1,52:09:00,"But we are not gonna you know, you know ask them to do a video saying that you studied with us and that is why you improve.",agent
1,52:16:00,"We generally ask them in terms of how their strategy has been, what are the things that they realised during their prep that they went wrong and what are the corrections that they made so that that can help students.",agent
1,52:24:00,"Even if you are someone who has not purchased our course, seeing this video should help you understand in terms of the those common strategies because you know, for each of the students, the challenges that face would be different.",agent
1,52:34:00,There is not a one stop solution.,agent
1,52:36:00,That's what we believe in.,agent
1,52:37:00,"That's why we create this custom study plan, custom course for each of the individual, for  and Nikita, for each of you, it's going to be a completely different journey in terms of your prep based on your strength, based on your weakness.",agent
1,52:48:00,"So you are going to have a different, even if both of you suppose ideally you both take a test today and each of you scored a 555, but the course duration in itself is going to be different for each of you because your percentiles in each of the scores and other elements that would come into play within bubble.",agent
1,53:05:00,"Also you have to see the CR percentile, RC percentile, all these things, your time commitment, lot of factors would account to and create a plan which is completely different for you than compared to the other person.",agent
1,53:16:00,So it is like a fingerprint.,agent
1,53:18:00,So that is that is the only way.,agent
1,53:20:00,A general course may help to an action but might not take you to that particular high score.,agent
1,53:26:00,Any general course can eventually take you to A 625 635 beat any course.,agent
1,53:30:00,I am not telling easy matter.,agent
1,53:32:00,Any course after a point can help you reach 625 635.,agent
1,53:37:00,That is not the big game.,agent
1,53:38:00,The game is from going from that 635 to 685 or 705 or even 735 which is 100 percentile.,agent
1,53:44:00,That is the big game.,agent
1,53:46:00,So that's the challenge.,agent
1,53:51:00,OK yeah.,prospect
1,53:52:00,So basically that's a gimmick kind of thing.,prospect
1,53:55:00,"And yeah it is, it is clearly gimmick.",agent
1,53:57:00,You just have to go and look at the terms and condition.,agent
1,53:59:00,"You realise if if you don't have to take take my things to face value, you just have to do it yourself.",agent
1,54:05:00,You have to realise that that's what they do.,agent
1,54:07:00,"So yeah, yeah, I have seen that they put the star Mark and they say either 70 point improvement or that thing.",prospect
1,54:14:00,I've seen that.,prospect
1,54:15:00,"I just, I wanted to confirm key.",prospect
1,54:17:00,Do you have that any kind of program something like that?,prospect
1,54:20:00,"But that's no, no, no, no, no.",agent
1,54:21:00,"OK, especially that is not gonna even help you because you're just starting your preparation, right?",agent
1,54:26:00,"So that's never gonna help you either in, in any of the platform.",agent
1,54:29:00,It's not gonna matter to you.,agent
1,54:30:00,"Because you see, generally if you are someone who's repeating after taking the test, maybe you already have a GMAT score.",agent
1,54:36:00,"In that case, you know, at least you would fall under that condition, you know, or if you at least you have an option that you get grade as and you know, avail that if it is not happening.",agent
1,54:46:00,"But you know, in in your case though, it is completely absurd, right?",agent
1,54:50:00,You you cannot take a test for it.,agent
1,54:53:00,Yeah.,prospect
1,54:53:00,Yeah.,prospect
1,54:54:00,So the so one other question is about the teachers.,prospect
1,54:57:00,Who are the teachers?,prospect
1,54:58:00,Like can you who is going to teach?,prospect
1,55:02:00,"Like there will be mentors and they are going to be teachers, right.",prospect
1,55:05:00,See our course are interactive video lessons in in in our case our course all are recorded sessions.,agent
1,55:11:00,That is why it is self based.,agent
1,55:13:00,We don't go in batches like 7 to 8:00 PM or 7 to 9:00 PM.,agent
1,55:16:00,We don't have that batches running.,agent
1,55:18:00,"And all the videos that you see here are majorly from you know, Kanupriya, which is top rated expert subject expert, you are going to have from Payal Rajat among the top 5, you know, subject experts or teachers in GMAT globally ranked.",agent
1,55:37:00,And so of course Fire and Rajat would be covering the major aspect of your prep.,agent
1,55:43:00,But you will also have videos sessions from other mentors.,agent
1,55:47:00,"So in terms of video lessons, it is going to be interactive lessons, interactive in the sense you start a video and within the video itself, you will have a lot of questions that follows up and based on your questions, your video might extend.",agent
1,55:59:00,Maybe a video can be the same video if you animation Nikita you are taking based on your feedbacks and how you answer them.,agent
1,56:07:00,"Video can be 15 minute, also a 20 minute video also depending upon the length depends upon how you respond to it.",agent
1,56:13:00,So that's why we call it interactive video lesson.,agent
1,56:14:00,And that's not the quiz.,agent
1,56:15:00,You would have a quiz to test your understanding.,agent
1,56:18:00,How much of it have you actually absorbed?,agent
1,56:20:00,You're going to have that that is separate towards the end of it.,agent
1,56:23:00,"But within the video itself, you're going to have some quizzes and all the things where you can learn and you know accordingly or you know the the course would adjust itself.",agent
1,56:31:00,"It's like, you know, we have this story mode kind of thing based on our choice.",agent
1,56:36:00,"It will navigate so in a way its like that for most of the videos and some videos are there, which is like a 10 minute video, 5 minute videos, which is quickly telling you are covering concepts.",agent
1,56:46:00,"Those is gonna those those videos are gonna be a very you know, straight forward videos, which will it will not be interactive.",agent
1,56:51:00,It will be a recorded video that you are gonna run through.,agent
1,56:55:00,"So, so that, that is how it is.",agent
1,56:57:00,"And yeah, Nikita hard for for the duration of the course, right, For the number of hours of the course, No, generally you, you can see your estimate here.",agent
1,57:12:00,There is an estimated course duration which is an average for completing critical reasoning.,agent
1,57:16:00,You have 30 hours to complete to complete your master comprehension.,agent
1,57:21:00,"You are going to have some, if you take master comprehension, it is, it is going to take around 7 hours, 24 minutes.",agent
1,57:27:00,It can take 8 hours for some people.,agent
1,57:28:00,It can be 7 hours for some people.,agent
1,57:30:00,"So, you know, plus or -30 minutes is is gonna happen.",agent
1,57:33:00,So that's why we call it estimated post duration.,agent
1,57:35:00,"So if we have a plain recorded session, maybe it can be even lesser.",agent
1,57:39:00,"But in this case though, depending, depending upon the scenario, it might differ.",agent
1,57:44:00,So that's why this estimated post duration is there.,agent
1,57:47:00,"And yeah, OK, so the mentors will be different and teachers will be different, right?",prospect
1,57:54:00,"Yeah, both would be different.",agent
1,57:56:00,"And you know, if if you have and you know, see of course you would have its like a YouTube video where each of the lessons would have a doubt session where ask an expert session would be there where your queries would be addressed.",agent
1,58:07:00,"But still, if it is not very clear, you just have to ping your mentor.",agent
1,58:12:00,"Your mentor would Even so in in the the video which I am going to send you regarding mentor, you would see that your mentor would even request or you know get a video pertaining to a doubt be recorded by your subject expert and share it to you.",agent
1,58:25:00,"So that also happens if for a particular file, if the communication or the doubt is not cleared, you are still stuck at it or you need a conceptual clarity for the your you know most most probably pile even even pile records or or you know Rajit also records and send your pertaining to a particular doubt.",agent
1,58:44:00,"They record 10 minute video, 15 minute video explaining you that particular doubt.",agent
1,58:48:00,"So first thing they might ask you is maybe you have to send a voice or something which clearly tells not in touch, but clearly tells them or and you know, make them understand what exactly is your doubt.",agent
1,58:58:00,"And accordingly, they will create a video and send it to you for you to, you know, view it and access it.",agent
1,59:03:00,So that that is one thing.,agent
1,59:06:00,"So these mentors are going to be there just to plan or preparation, right?",prospect
1,59:12:00,They are not there to not just planning see you know like so during initial series they are there see they you will have their direct inbox to your mentors.,agent
1,59:21:00,You're gonna communicate it's like the old Facebook Messenger you see right you're gonna have the direct inbox to your mentor which you're gonna connect and discuss.,agent
1,59:28:00,"So initially in terms of strategy, there is nothing much that they will be doing.",agent
1,59:32:00,They are just they are just gonna be a guiding force.,agent
1,59:36:00,But the game changes when you when you reach a 635 beyond that point.,agent
1,59:41:00,See all the data that you capture here.,agent
1,59:42:00,You will have a dashboard here when you're going to go and take this test.,agent
1,59:45:00,But these are not just the dashboards.,agent
1,59:47:00,Your mentor would be creating a profile for you from the day you start.,agent
1,59:51:00,You are you are going to have a profile built by a mentor.,agent
1,59:54:00,"So once you reach a 635, then you are going to get into a teams call with your mentor at a regular interval, may be once in a day or once in 2 days.",agent
1,01:00:02,You are going to have that connect with your mentor in detail to actually understand or or to strategise and give you that corrective factors in terms of how to improve your time in those particular questions and what is exactly so like the way if you know.,agent
1,01:00:16,"We have a cricket team of analysts, right, For every, every top cricket teams.",agent
1,01:00:20,"Now we have analysts coming into play to help the players understand what's his strength, what's his weakness and how to how to navigate things, how to improve with the help of coach.",agent
1,01:00:28,So mentors are basically a coach with a high analytic support or analytics behind it to give you that instructive feedbacks.,agent
1,01:00:38,OK.,prospect
1,01:00:38,"And so we will be collecting Yeah, yeah, I was saying for now for actual doubt resolution, we have to reach out to the teachers directly.",prospect
1,01:00:52,"No, you you have to see one thing is you can reach out to your tutors directly through the section doubt clearing sessions that you would see under each video lessons.",agent
1,01:01:02,You are going to have that.,agent
1,01:01:03,"But beyond that, if you want to personally reach out like like want them to record a video for you and and have to clear it right away for pertaining to a particular topics, you can navigate through your mentor.",agent
1,01:01:17,Your mentor is actually going to help you facilitate it.,agent
1,01:01:20,"OK, OK, understood.",prospect
1,01:01:23,So this mentor will be connected only through this your channel Egmat channel or its going to connect it through WhatsApp as well?,prospect
1,01:01:32,"No, initially it will be through Egmat channel.",agent
1,01:01:34,"So see the, the main scenario is different.",agent
1,01:01:38,"See till the time you reach like the way I always say till you reach that 85th percentile capability, the instructions are going to be very clear and straightforward that what exactly has to be done you are going to have.",agent
1,01:01:50,"So once, once I share you a video like the way I said once I share you that video and to go through it yet have a clear clarity.",agent
1,01:01:55,"But I am still telling giving an overview that initially it is very straightforward in terms of your instruction and things are going to be very clear in terms of what activities has to be done wherever your feedback is required, chat support is enough.",agent
1,01:02:07,"But later on once once you reach that last mail, so we enroll UNLA program called last Mail push that is also free of cost.",agent
1,01:02:14,You are not going to be charged for that.,agent
1,01:02:15,It is inclusive within the course.,agent
1,01:02:17,"So what happens there is when you reach that capability, it becomes bit of tricky even for us to explain things over chat.",agent
1,01:02:25,It is not possible that we explain everything through chat and the communication has to be more efficient and we involve you in a Teams call.,agent
1,01:02:33,And at that point of time of course maybe you would reach get get the connect with your mentor in WhatsApp and all these things you start that would be the last leg of your breath.,agent
1,01:02:41,Maybe last one month or one and half months it is going to be but initially we don't do that because of course the bandwidth is also there.,agent
1,01:02:47,"They have to support you know, you know you and and give you that right guidance.",agent
1,01:02:51,"So of course you know, initially, sorry, not through WhatsApp.",agent
1,01:02:58,"So not initially initially, initially not through WhatsApp.",agent
1,01:03:00,"Yeah, OK.",prospect
1,01:03:03,"So once he once you reach that 64563555 yeah, then then we'll be connected through WhatsApp.",agent
1,01:03:10,"Yeah yeah, mostly 635 some cases 625.",agent
1,01:03:13,"Also we we, we generally once you reach around 85th percentile, we ourselves would enroll you in last mile much program that would change the dynamics.",agent
1,01:03:20,So that's what is required for you to go from that 625 to 7 or 5 to 25.,agent
1,01:03:25,"So soon after this call, I'm going to send you a video which is actually going to clear your doubts regarding what is mentor.",agent
1,01:03:31,What does the mentor do for you?,agent
1,01:03:32,You're going to have that clear instructions there.,agent
1,01:03:34,OK so another thing is on GMAT club or somewhere I was reading the one of guy was posted some good reviews about E GMAT that he needed more help because he had very less time to prepare and one of the Co founder had come and taught him.,prospect
1,01:03:54,So does that happen at the E GMAT or what?,prospect
1,01:03:58,"See depending upon multiple scenarios, that's what I was telling one of the Co founder Payal like the way I said, I said none that they would record the session or they would come in directly.",agent
1,01:04:07,So this is something which we don't promise as a part of course.,agent
1,01:04:09,"See when we start something, if you promise then it has to be delivered right?",agent
1,01:04:13,So if you promise it that you know the founders are going to help you and they are going to do that thing may not happen depending upon your situation and your genuinity towards your prep.,agent
1,01:04:23,"Maybe it is not that from day one the student actually had come by, maybe for a particular scenario they would have come.",agent
1,01:04:28,So based on the situation and what makes more sense we would do it for our students.,agent
1,01:04:33,So generally we do that lot of things beyond the scope of what we commit.,agent
1,01:04:38,"We do that, but that is not something which we mentioned in our in the starting discussion itself.",agent
1,01:04:43,"So that, you know, if you set that expectation then you would purchase just for that, right?",agent
1,01:04:47,"You would be purchasing your, making your we would be influencing your purchase decision just based on that.",agent
1,01:04:52,"And if that is not happening, then you would be, you know, disappointed as well.",agent
1,01:04:56,"If maybe a situation arises where we feel that that's not required and we don't do it, but you feel it's required and then you think that I purchased for this and I didn't get it.",agent
1,01:05:05,So we don't want that confusion to happen.,agent
1,01:05:06,"But of course, one thing you can be very assured about this, whatever or to whatever extent we need to go to get to your target score, they would be doing it.",agent
1,01:05:17,"So our goal is if, if you have to go for 4 months and we have to hit that score, whatever extent that we need to go, we, we are going to do that and make you, you know, reach that score.",agent
1,01:05:26,Provided you are also getting that kind of commitments.,agent
1,01:05:29,"We would see right, based on your scores, how, how much time you spend in our platform, even every, every minute you spend in our platform, we are going to see that how many minutes to an extent of how many minutes and how many seconds you are spending our platform, We are going to get that clarity.",agent
1,01:05:42,"So a lot of factors would account for and for us to create a decision or, you know, make a decision in terms of what kind of support to be done.",agent
1,01:05:49,"If you are legitimate, you, you are really see the student and you need some help, of course we will be there.",agent
1,01:05:54,"So, so, so that's, that's the idea.",agent
1,01:05:58,OK.,prospect
1,01:05:59,"Another thing is, so this is about GMAT.",prospect
1,01:06:02,"So yeah, regarding the admission support, do you have anything like that?",prospect
1,01:06:08,Lets say this is GMAT.,prospect
1,01:06:10,"I got some fantastic, fantastic score.",prospect
1,01:06:12,"But after that we have any support for the admission like we would guide, we would guide and help you understand a lot of things.",prospect
1,01:06:19,"Again, see our our platform in itself is a GMAT platform, GMAT prep platform and our focus is strictly towards that.",agent
1,01:06:27,See even even most of the other providers also charge extra for your you know other support and all this things.,agent
1,01:06:34,But we are not into that services yet like we are.,agent
1,01:06:37,"We were we are very clear that our focus is to get people, our students to a particular target score and then get it by.",agent
1,01:06:43,"But couple of things that you can expect is the students who may be your targets school may not be the first school, right?",agent
1,01:06:51,We would have already had students who have already joined there.,agent
1,01:06:53,"Maybe we can give you the not the contact number, but the contact details like LinkedIn and other platforms where you can reach out to them and check with them.",agent
1,01:07:01,So the alums kind of thing.,agent
1,01:07:03,We can you know help you out.,agent
1,01:07:06,So you know all those things would be there towards the end of this.,agent
1,01:07:09,"You know we are pre once you have a score of course we will be helping you in all those terms, but not with their essays not with their application.",agent
1,01:07:15,Technically we will not be sitting with you.,agent
1,01:07:17,"So like the way we commit for GMAT, we don't have anything that we have.",agent
1,01:07:21,"We would commit and do it for your, you know, preparation.",agent
1,01:07:26,You would have to look it on your own.,agent
1,01:07:28,"But of course you whatever queries you have, you know, regarding where to approach, how to do it, how to do this, all these things, you are going to get clear instructions.",agent
1,01:07:37,"Your support is, you know, you can expect a support or guidance, but not a service.",agent
1,01:07:44,"OK, OK, no problem.",prospect
1,01:07:46,Yeah.,prospect
1,01:07:46,OK.,prospect
1,01:07:46,"So maybe the last leg of the question like do you have yeah, referral kind of thing like do you have any insider coupon that can reduce the priced not, not a referral coupon.",prospect
1,01:08:02,"See, see, we generally see most of the cases.",agent
1,01:08:04,I will tell you one thing very honestly 65% of the calls that gets booked majorly are through either either no our students generally the remaining 45 would come from our people seeing our GMAT club reviews and all this things would come to many 45%.,agent
1,01:08:20,"But to be honest, I am telling you more than 50%, around 60%, 55% to 60% of the crowd are coming through either one of our old EEZ math students referring through or the existing students referring through.",agent
1,01:08:33,So we don't have a referral bonus as such.,agent
1,01:08:39,But yeah.,agent
1,01:08:40,So if if there are a couple of peoples who start together in in that case we generally give an extension.,agent
1,01:08:46,So that's what we generally give best maybe a 15 days section from both of the students.,agent
1,01:08:51,"Like if if you if either of you are starting may be one day, 2 day prior difference is also fine.",agent
1,01:08:56,"But if there is a considerable difference in your case Nikita, you still want a time to think over it and come back.",agent
1,01:09:02,So in that case that may not be applicable.,agent
1,01:09:04,"But yeah, generally you know, if if both of the people are planning to purchase together may be in one or 2 days time here and there that that is OK.",agent
1,01:09:13,We would give a 15 days extension worth of $49 you are going to get.,agent
1,01:09:21,"OK, yeah.",prospect
1,01:09:24,So the final price will be one 59159.,agent
1,01:09:27,"If you know after 30 days like the way we discuss, you can pay the difference and you know get 4 months or 6 months.",agent
1,01:09:36,"OK, OK, so I will drop you the mail regarding the same.",agent
1,01:09:39,I have added you in the mail thread.,agent
1,01:09:43,"Yeah, maybe today only I'll make the purchase and we'll start from.",prospect
1,01:09:46,So are you one of the mentors to.,prospect
1,01:09:48,"No, no, I'm.",agent
1,01:09:49,I'm not a mentor.,agent
1,01:09:50,"So I'm just there to give you a very clear idea on what you are purchasing and to give you a whole insight in terms of, you know, clear the queries before you get in.",agent
1,01:09:58,So my role is limited to that.,agent
1,01:10:00,So we have experts out there as mentors who would actually do the job for you.,agent
1,01:10:05,So my role is just to give an idea of what you are getting into.,agent
1,01:10:09,OK.,prospect
1,01:10:09,"And another thing, so before assigning the mentor, do you give us the list of mentors and then we have to select or is just going to be random?",prospect
1,01:10:19,Not random.,agent
1,01:10:20,"See, So what we are going to do is you know, we, you're going to send a mail.",agent
1,01:10:25,I will help you with the format.,agent
1,01:10:26,"You're going to send a mail once you make the purchase from that registered mail ID, you're going to send a mail mentioning about your profile in terms of, you know, you may be a tech, you know, education background.",agent
1,01:10:37,And you can also mention about you starting your prep.,agent
1,01:10:41,"You have not, you know, taken any mock.",agent
1,01:10:43,"So you can mention that and you can also give your, you know, time duration, how many hours in a week you can prepare all these things and your target score, your targets.",agent
1,01:10:51,Cool.,prospect
1,01:10:52,"You can mention all those things and your deadline also, you're gonna mention it and you're gonna request a mentor.",agent
1,01:10:56,"So that's gonna go to that support mail support at the rate it is gmail.com from the support team, that mail would actually go to the, you know, mentors page.",agent
1,01:11:05,So from there whichever mentor suits your profile and has the bandwidth would be registered.,agent
1,01:11:11,"So it is not ran its its based on us deciding you know who would be the best person for you, we would be assigning them.",agent
1,01:11:17,So that is how it happens.,agent
1,01:11:20,"OK, Yeah, yeah.",prospect
1,01:11:23,One last question out of curiosity.,prospect
1,01:11:26,"So now while going through the website, we saw this tall claims that that are over there on E GMAT where you have compared E GMAT with other GMAT platforms, GMAT preparation platforms.",prospect
1,01:11:37,"Yeah, for how, how exactly do you validate these this data, see these to be honest, these data are in public.",agent
1,01:11:45,"If you look at the you know, what exact claims are you looking for that result, right?",agent
1,01:11:51,"The, you know, 3 times the result that you would see all the things, right, right, right.",agent
1,01:11:57,"Yeah, All these data are in public.",agent
1,01:11:59,"All these data are in public in, in GMAT reviews and you know, all the platforms and even that that is one of the examples.",agent
1,01:12:05,"As I said, you can look at all the test providers, their YouTube channels as well.",agent
1,01:12:10,"You know, in terms of every, every, every, you know, you know, the top test providers have this channel and they would post videos as well as on occurrence.",agent
1,01:12:20,"So you just see the number of, you know, outputs or reviews coming by and the results coming by and you yourself would know the difference.",agent
1,01:12:27,"And GMAT Club is not a place where you can do a PR because maybe in Google you can put reviews, you can, you know, do a PR and get your ratings up.",agent
1,01:12:36,"But GMAT Club you can actually get put your reviews and you have to be verified to get that, you know, to public.",agent
1,01:12:44,"So you know, they, they verify based on your score, you should have a valid GMAT score before you put a review.",agent
1,01:12:49,"And you have to send them the proofs that you say, you know, you prepared using this platform, whatever it is, you have to send the proofs and get it validated to make it public.",agent
1,01:12:57,So all those reviews that you see are organic reviews that you'd see there.,agent
1,01:13:01,And those are real feedbacks.,agent
1,01:13:02,And we claim on the on the basis of those feedbacks which is available in public.,agent
1,01:13:08,"So, you know, we generally cannot make false claims said that that is against the you know, law as well.",agent
1,01:13:14,We cannot Simply put anything that we that comes to our mind.,agent
1,01:13:18,"So yeah, so whatever we have mentioned is true to the court.",agent
1,01:13:23,So all the all the reviews that you would see there and then the comparison as well.,agent
1,01:13:28,We are very bold enough to compare all the test providers within our platform itself in terms of their rate success rate.,agent
1,01:13:33,So all this are data which is available in public with which you have competed and created that and what they provide.,agent
1,01:13:38,So we have put some comparisons as well in terms of the top provider.,agent
1,01:13:41,So you can you can check with those as well.,agent
1,01:13:45,So all those are based on legit date like it is not just a gimmick or something which we created out of there.,agent
1,01:13:50,Fair enough.,prospect
1,01:13:54,"Yeah, yeah, OK.",prospect
1,01:13:55,That is it from my side as well.,prospect
1,01:14:01,Yes.,unknown
1,01:14:04,Thank you so much Amrut.,prospect
1,01:14:05,"Yes, yes, yes.",agent
1,01:14:07,So let me know I will drop you the mail in some time and then I will make a purchase and I will send you those copy as well.,prospect
1,01:14:17,"Sure Sir, you can do that.",agent
1,01:14:18,"And Nikita, just to have an idea, when are you planning to start?",agent
1,01:14:24,Any idea?,agent
1,01:14:25,"Will it be this month, next month or you want to take a time and then decide she just graduate?",agent
1,01:14:31,"Yeah, sorry.",prospect
1,01:14:33,"So she's just graduate, so she's got some time.",prospect
1,01:14:38,OK.,agent
1,01:14:39,OK.,agent
1,01:14:40,"So yeah, so so this is it.",agent
1,01:14:44,"So you can, and I wish you can give a number to Nikita, give my number to Nikita.",agent
1,01:14:50,"So if whenever you decide on the course or something, reach out to me so we can work on the best price.",agent
1,01:14:57,"Then if some discounts are running at that point of time, we can discuss on that at that, that level.",agent
1,01:15:02,"And by the way, you can also get a direct, you know, review from  itself in terms of how the course and prep went.",agent
1,01:15:08,"If you are planning to take it later, you can get a very close feedback as well.",agent
1,01:15:12,So you can decide on that.,agent
1,01:15:15,"Yes, yes, thank you Amrit.",prospect
1,01:15:17,"Alright, see you, see you guys.",agent
1,01:15:19,Bye bye.,agent
1,01:15:21,Have a good day.,prospect
1,01:15:21,Bye.,prospect
1,01:15:21,Bye.,prospect
1,01:15:22,"Yeah, same to you.",agent
1,01:15:23,Bye.,agent
22,00:05,Hello.,unknown
22,00:06,Hello.,unknown
22,00:08,"Hey, .",agent
22,00:11,Yeah.,prospect
22,00:11,Hi.,prospect
22,00:12,Good evening.,agent
22,00:13,"Yeah, hi.",prospect
22,00:14,Good evening.,agent
22,00:14,How are you doing?,agent
22,00:16,I am good.,agent
22,00:16,How are you?,agent
22,00:19,"Bit sick, but yeah, thanks to you.",prospect
22,00:22,Yeah.,agent
22,00:23,"So , you know I saw your message.",agent
22,00:27,"So you are planning to take in 3 to 4 months, right?",agent
22,00:32,Ji Mad.,prospect
22,00:32,"So OK, so let me tell you I am planning to go for an executive MBA that is a full time MBA that is in I am Ahmedabad OK.",prospect
22,00:42,And for that I read that requirements it was mentioned that it was only accepting the GMAT that you have given on the at the test center OK OK.,prospect
22,00:54,And my target for giving that GMAT is within 34 months.,prospect
22,01:00,"OK, understood.",agent
22,01:04,So for this call is majorly for you to understand or for you to ask queries regarding the e GMAT platform and how it is or you know any questions related to a GMAT feel free to open.,agent
22,01:16,We don't go by the agenda or a presentation mode.,agent
22,01:19,"It is just that we do it candidate the candidate wave based on whatever you would like to ask and yeah, we can do that.",agent
22,01:25,How did you hear about us anyway?,agent
22,01:27,"Yeah, I search on the GMAT classes and E GMAT what is the name coming up?",prospect
22,01:33,"So I tried OK, so OK, so you got it from YouTube, is it?",agent
22,01:41,"No, no, I saw it on Google GMAT, GMAT lashes so and your g your company name came up.",prospect
22,01:48,Yeah.,agent
22,01:50,"So OK, So what are your questions?",agent
22,01:52,So this session you have booked for clearing your queries.,agent
22,01:56,So what are your questions?,agent
22,01:58,I told you my requirements and so then how you can help me out for regarding the thing.,prospect
22,02:05,Yeah.,agent
22,02:05,"See, you know, your target should be somewhere around, you know, 665 to 675.",agent
22,02:13,"You know, the Classic edition.",agent
22,02:14,Earlier we had something called Classic Edition.,agent
22,02:16,"Classic Edition was a test which has stopped from to the 22,023.",agent
22,02:20,"But if you just Google the score requirement, you would see 700 plus.",agent
22,02:24,But 700 plus is a remark of Classic Edition.,agent
22,02:27,Now the test has changed.,agent
22,02:29,Focus Edition is a bit more tougher so 645 in focus is equal into 700 earlier.,agent
22,02:34,So in your case you have to look for A665675 which is around 95th percentile is what you need to chase for.,agent
22,02:43,"I am Ahmedabad executive MBA Yeah yeah to if you have to maximise your chances, the save score, you can still get through with the 6645 also, but to higher your chances and especially because you have 3 to 4 months of time, 675 would be a great, you know, score to actually apply with.",agent
22,03:07,"OK, so how is your syllabus and training and all Yeah.",prospect
22,03:12,So you have a very defined syllabus for GMAT.,agent
22,03:16,If you if you look at let me just share my screen.,agent
22,03:25,"If you just see we have verbal quants and data insights, 3 sections, 45 minutes each.",agent
22,03:32,"Verbal has 23 questions, Quant has 21 questions and data insights has 20 questions.",agent
22,03:37,So that is how the structure is for 45 minutes each.,agent
22,03:39,And within verbal you have mainly 2 sections.,agent
22,03:42,That is critical distance and reading comprehension.,agent
22,03:44,These are the 2 sections that you want to find in verbal.,agent
22,03:47,"And in our case, we cover from the fundamentals.",agent
22,03:51,That is why you see master comprehensive.,agent
22,03:52,"It is going to help you cover from the fundamental so that yeah, you do not need a brush up before you take the course because we only do your brush up in terms of your you know you don't have to actually waste your time doing brush up before during the course because we come from the fundamentals in coins.",agent
22,04:08,Also we have arithmetic in the algebra.,agent
22,04:10,"Arithmetic is divided into number of properties, word problems and advanced topics and algebra is there.",agent
22,04:17,Then we start with quant basics here also.,agent
22,04:20,"So all are interactive video lessons that you are going to go through with each, you know, lessons you are going to have a quiz towards and to understand how much have you actually absorbed.",agent
22,04:30,"For example, if we teach you say 1 + 7 is 8, we would ask you 3 + 9.",agent
22,04:36,"So you know you should know how to apply their learnings rather than just you know, doing the same question.",agent
22,04:42,So the quiz is like an application based model which will understand or give you an idea how much have you actually absorbed.,agent
22,04:50,"So free material also in your website, GEG math, some courses and tutorial correct free country.",prospect
22,04:56,You have a free trial randomly taken couple of files from essential quant.,agent
22,05:03,So that is just for you to understand how we teach you.,agent
22,05:06,"You just have to just checkout those videos, which should clearly indicate you that how, how how do we teach?",agent
22,05:11,"If you are comfortable with it, you can actually go for the purchase of the course.",agent
22,05:16,that's how it is.,prospect
22,05:16,So there is no live classes.,prospect
22,05:21,"We can go for live classes, but we what we recommend is first start with see life classes can be anytime be an add on like $49 can be an add on for any of the month and choose life class.",agent
22,05:35,"No need to purchase from the beginning, but you can always go for life plus, you know self face course.",agent
22,05:42,"So if you would want to go for that, that would be it.",agent
22,05:46,So life plus self face course is what we have.,agent
22,05:49,"But if you say to be honest, this classes itself is enough because if you are working professional, maybe you might not find the I mean.",agent
22,05:59,So it will be batch wise session.,prospect
22,06:01,It will not be one on one.,prospect
22,06:02,It will not be batch wise.,agent
22,06:04,It will be a batch wise session which might happen in a Standard Time.,agent
22,06:08,"So if you are not able to attend it evening mostly, it will be mostly evening 8:00 or 830.",agent
22,06:13,It is when the so yeah.,agent
22,06:19,So that that is when it is.,agent
22,06:21,"And even with the self based course also for students, we give some free webinars also you see here ace reading conversation and MSR on GMAT, ace arithmetic.",agent
22,06:31,"So when see you say 9:30 PM, you know PS T that is 11:00 AM IST on Sunday, Saturday it is 11:00 AM.",agent
22,06:40,"So Saturday, Sunday in the morning sessions.",agent
22,06:43,So that's how that's how it is going to be.,agent
22,06:48,"So free, free sessions.",agent
22,06:49,I am talking about the free sessions.,agent
22,06:50,"Even if you are selfish course without life, still you can have some webinars and all this instead.",agent
22,06:55,But a live course would be where we would be taking topic wise a new batch shots every alternate Saturdays.,agent
22,07:02,So you don't necessarily have to you know.,agent
22,07:06,So every every session we make sure that we are not keeping continuity.,agent
22,07:10,"We finish a particular, take a topic particularly we finish and then go to the next.",agent
22,07:14,So you don't have to worry that OK this session I didn't attempt the next session.,agent
22,07:18,I should you know watch it you can attend and then watch it later.,agent
22,07:22,Also because it will be different topics for different days.,agent
22,07:26,What is the duration for that?,prospect
22,07:30,For which one live class?,agent
22,07:35,Live class would be around 2 hours of session is what you would be having top big wise.,agent
22,07:40,So generally life classes are recommended for students who already have an understanding so that the questions discussed would be a high level questions.,agent
22,07:47,So suppose initially you are just starting and you are not aware of the concepts you attend live class you would feel left out.,agent
22,07:54,So that is why I was suggesting you to not go in the initial month itself may be from the second month or 3rd month you can pay $49 and then at it.,agent
22,08:03,So by that you would have complete you know completed significant amount of portion.,agent
22,08:07,"So when you attend it, it is going to be productive for you.",agent
22,08:11,In live classes they don't teach concepts they directly go to the question solving questions questions already.,agent
22,08:17,Because live classes are designed for students who want to solve hard questions with the tutor.,agent
22,08:22,So in live class you have to.,agent
22,08:24,So for students maybe if who is already at a you know 5556 not 5 kind of score would generally purchase from day one itself.,agent
22,08:32,But in your case if you are just starting by I think eventually you will regret.,agent
22,08:37,So I don't want you to regret so that's why I am just telling you.,agent
22,08:40,You can purchase up to 2 months where you cover signature promotion.,agent
22,08:45,What?,prospect
22,08:46,"OK so you are telling me to go for self age course, recorded course?",prospect
22,08:52,Yes go for self age course and then switch to live classes.,agent
22,08:55,If you have the bandwidth you have to switch to live classes to solve hard level questions along with your tutor you can clear your doubts and all these things live classes.,agent
22,09:04,So we can look into it and what about the mock test?,prospect
22,09:11,You will have 5 full length adaptive mock test with the course.,agent
22,09:15,"So you will have 90 plus sectional mocks for verbal separate, coin separate and DA separate.",agent
22,09:21,Then you will have subsectional mocks and custom quizzes as well.,agent
22,09:24,Let me show you.,agent
22,09:28,"So if you look at say verbal verbal incept you have cementing quizzes, which is subsectional mocks around 9030 each for verbal content DA and then sectional mocks, then custom quizzes to do targeted learning.",agent
22,09:40,Shall I send you 17 minute video which is very important regarding the mental support.,agent
22,09:45,So I will I will talk about the mental support.,agent
22,09:46,You will have some questions also very mental support.,agent
22,09:49,But I would suggest you to watch the 7 minute video pause here and watch the 7 minute video.,agent
22,09:54,Can you do that?,agent
22,09:54,I will just sending you the link so that I I want to address your questions in this call itself.,agent
22,10:02,"So I will I will send you, you get pause watch that 7 minute video and then we will join back and discuss.",agent
22,10:09,"You can play it here only No, on your screen.",prospect
22,10:10,So it is OK.,agent
22,10:11,You cannot hear.,agent
22,10:12,You cannot hear you.,agent
22,10:14,You not get the audio.,agent
22,10:16,That is the trouble.,agent
22,10:18,"OK, OK Theek.",prospect
22,10:19,Yeah yeah.,prospect
22,10:27,You are sending me the chat box.,prospect
22,10:30,You want in chat box.,agent
22,10:31,I can send in chat box.,agent
22,10:32,I sent in WhatsApp chat box should be great.,agent
22,10:35,"Yeah, I will send it to you in chat box.",agent
22,10:45,Got it.,prospect
22,10:47,Yeah.,prospect
22,10:47,So I will just mute my just 7 minute.,prospect
22,10:50,"Yeah, it is a 7 minute video.",agent
22,10:52,You can mute yourself and once it is done I will be here.,agent
22,10:55,Only you can let me know.,agent
22,10:57,"OK, Yeah.",prospect
22,17:08,"Hello, yeah yeah I saw this with you.",prospect
22,17:13,So let me do one thing.,prospect
22,17:16,The amount that I will be going to pay that will include the mentor and that is also image of application mentor not a live phone one on one call.,prospect
22,17:25,So mentorship happens in 2 phases.,agent
22,17:27,Initially you would have this mentorship in chat and mail you this.,agent
22,17:31,You see this chat window right?,agent
22,17:32,"Like the old Facebook Messenger, wherever you have doubt you are, ping them, they are going to get a pop up.",agent
22,17:37,"The response you are going to get a pop up if in case even if you are not in the platform, you are going to get a mail as well a notification so that you would be aware that OK, your mentor has responded.",agent
22,17:46,That is one thing that is still you reach a score of 625.,agent
22,17:51,"So once you are at 6:25, you would be enrolled in a program called last mile push program LMP program that also is inclusive within the course you are not going to be charged.",agent
22,18:01,"So what happens in Last mile Push program is see the purpose of Last Mile Push program is if I consider 2 person person A and person B, person A with a score of 625 which is around 8 5th percentile and person B with the score of you know 735 which is 100 percentile.",agent
22,18:18,"If I give them a test GMAT test and instead of 2 and half hours if I give them say 4 hours of time, surprisingly what you would say is both of them would have almost the same score.",agent
22,18:27,"So the idea is once you reach a 625, there is nothing much at a conceptual level that you have to sit and watch or learn.",agent
22,18:34,What you need is a fine tuning in your technique and time management.,agent
22,18:39,And that cannot happen via chat because it becomes too complicated to explain things in chat.,agent
22,18:44,"So in the last mail push program, you would be getting the OR connected with the mentor and teams call where they would come in and they would, you know, share their screen, show you the stats based on how you performed here.",agent
22,18:55,We collect a lot of data.,agent
22,18:56,"This business that you see, it's not just accuracy.",agent
22,18:59,"We collect your average correct time, incorrect time, the pressure plots and all these things and then accordingly we give you suggestions in terms of fine tuning and improvement of time.",agent
22,19:09,So that is what your mental doing and that will be a one on one live session that will be having with the mentor free of cost.,agent
22,19:16,So the program is called the last mail Bush even you would be involved in.,agent
22,19:20,"So in just to give you a clarity, all the students who you see here in our platform TGMAT in U2, all the students got 685695685 655675 all the students have part of last meal question program that is a default part of our course.",agent
22,19:37,And that is one of the reasons why we have this huge success.,agent
22,19:40,You just have to see one thing all prep providers would have their own I mean YouTube channels.,agent
22,19:46,"So just check how many verified reviews or you know verified videos are coming from their end and you will be surprised to see that we have 3 extra time of success rates, you know, published and.",agent
22,20:00,"With a score of 675 plus, so you know, just just to give you that testimony and all these videos are not just in a 2 minute video messaging that hey, I learned from here.",agent
22,20:11,That is why I was able to succeed.,agent
22,20:12,No Sir.,agent
22,20:14,"Strategic discussion videos are of 40 minutes, 30 minutes, all the things where they would discuss their journey, which eventually even if you are not plan purchasing our course, you want to do a cell study.",agent
22,20:25,These videos could be helpful if you are travelling or something just listen to this listen to this videos would be really helpful for you to understand and come over some of the you know aspects.,agent
22,20:34,"Of course each students journey would be different, but the core of it would be the same.",agent
22,20:40,So they have and means every student here has embedded your course correct?,prospect
22,20:46,"Yeah, every student is part of you know has studied in our course and you know all the students are part of the normal mentorship program as well as once 625 from 625.",agent
22,20:55,All the scores here are 625 plus studied at least 645655 is what you going to see.,agent
22,21:01,You don't even see 635 here.,agent
22,21:03,So everybody is part of the last value push program and everybody was our student.,agent
22,21:06,"So and we we cannot randomly post someone you know account right And if you look at GMAT club, GMAT club is a place where you find the largest community of GMAT.",agent
22,21:17,You know aspirants across the globe.,agent
22,21:20,If we just go there and check the number of reviews you would see we have towards the times number of reviews with a score of 4.8.,agent
22,21:26,"So the reason is because, you know, so we cannot simply go and nobody can do a PR work there.",agent
22,21:34,"Nobody can go there and just, you know, give a review, posture review.",agent
22,21:39,"You have to show your actual score, you have submit your actual report and you also have to show that you studied in this place.",agent
22,21:45,You actually give a review.,agent
22,21:47,So all all are verified reviews.,agent
22,21:49,"And that is why you would see only around, you know, 2000, 3000 kind of reviews because it is a tedious process and only the people who are really interested would do that.",agent
22,21:57,"And yeah, so you'd see compared to the top test providers, what what's the difference you would see, will I not get the mba.com test mock test that is available paid test including this course?",prospect
22,22:11,"No, we have a dedicated test.",agent
22,22:12,"No, we have spent millions of dollars in R&D to create a finding the fine tune test, which is replica of your action agreement.",agent
22,22:19,So you have 5 full length tests within our platform itself because you have 3.,agent
22,22:24,"That test is a computer based like we have a negative marking and if you answer right, the answer means the next question is more harder and then if you get it wrong, yeah, it's adaptive.",prospect
22,22:37,Yeah.,agent
22,22:37,"So your is also adaptive and exactly, exactly.",agent
22,22:41,So all the students which you see here it may be can try to contribute them in LinkedIn.,agent
22,22:45,"Unfortunately, if phone numbers cannot be shared because you know, that's private even even you know, if you are also in future coming here, we cannot share your phone number also.",agent
22,22:55,"So you can reach out to these people and LinkedIn, they have studied there, you can get a real time, you know, inputs from them and all the tests, all the students would say one thing that the score is plus or -10 from the actual marks that they have taken towards the end, they have got a plus or -10 So that is a really good, you know, accuracy in terms of the actual test.",agent
22,23:16,"So, so so just just to answer your question, yes, our courses, our section marks are adaptive and that is the only way we can actually checkout how many more sectional adaptive 90 mocks 5 full length test 90 sectional mocks.",agent
22,23:36,"OK sectional mock means mock for your verbal, mock for your quant mock for your data and separately OK yeah, you can even get the our sectional mock are also adaptive it minors the actual, you know, GMAT scenario.",prospect
22,23:53,So if verbal is there 45 minute 26 question adaptive and you will have to solve it in the real time.,agent
22,23:58,So Nestle you not need not take the full length test to check your level before verbal.,agent
22,24:04:00,"See, once you complete your verbal, you are going to test your sections first and verbal to understand if you have improved and all these things and then Quans India all these sections.",agent
22,24:13:00,OK so in the GMAT exam do they give us means pen paper to write solve the questions in the if I go to you will you will get a notepad no computerized notepad in real exam not computerized notepad.,prospect
22,24:28:00,You can actually you will also get a physical notepad in your actual term.,agent
22,24:33:00,"And what about the study materials you will be giving me the that registered official book guides as a you to to be honest, you don't need the official guide because our see to create a platform.",prospect
22,24:48:00,We have been existing since as a platform since 2008.,agent
22,24:52:00,"So we are the Ogs of you know, GMAT pref in terms of online GMAT since 2008.",agent
22,24:59:00,"So we have done a lot of you know, millions of dollars we have spent for the course and all these things, which in itself is sufficient.",agent
22,25:07:00,So that's that's a one stop solution for all the questions.,agent
22,25:09:00,"But if in case you want the mock, this is not an e GMAT offering, but I can I have some PDF of it.",agent
22,25:16:00,I can send you some PDF version of the mock like the OG not the mock the OG original guides 44 books are there.,agent
22,25:24:00,I can send you the PDFNVC test is going to be online right?,agent
22,25:27:00,"So you don't have to purchase a physical book, you can actually do it from that PDF books itself.",agent
22,25:34:00,Then the the Ogs are generally designed for towards the end of your prep to use a question bank.,agent
22,25:40:00,It is not something which you are you have to use as a study material.,agent
22,25:44:00,It is a question bank that you are you have to use towards the end of your prep.,agent
22,25:48:00,"So mentor would clearly tell you when to use and all the things OK, so study materials is the videos that you will do a you have recommended me during the initial time self based recordings right right of you will be interactive video lessons.",prospect
22,26:05:00,"Interactive means no, it's a recorded session.",prospect
22,26:07:00,So how it can be interactive?,prospect
22,26:09:00,I I will show you.,agent
22,26:10:00,So suppose if you know you are every every videos as as they start put test with a pre quiz.,agent
22,26:18:00,"I will I will just quickly rather show you OK and how much Yeah, before you show me, can you just tell me one more answer key when by what?",agent
22,26:38:00,What is the turn around time by which is the the reviewer or the my guide replies to me.,prospect
22,26:44:00,Suppose I have raised one query.,prospect
22,26:45:00,What is the tat they take 18 hours maximum in us.,agent
22,26:50:00,"But because when you depending upon what you ask, if it is very simple to communicate, it will be fast.",agent
22,26:56:00,But if you have a doubt or something where we have to record and send it to you maximum 18 hours.,agent
22,26:59:00,So that is the rat.,agent
22,27:03:00,"Can you suppose I am feeling any, any issues with the same or any technical issue, whatever kind of issue, whom do I contact?",prospect
22,27:11:00,"Because everything is online, no Technical Support is going to be the 3rd stat is going to be around, you know, 3 hours or something.",agent
22,27:18:00,"So you reach out be 3 to 4 hours the Technical Support or something or the other and if you actually have doubt regarding platform itself, you can reach out to me directly.",agent
22,27:29:00,Then the tab is like do you guys have any office in Mumbai?,prospect
22,27:34:00,"No, we don't have an office in Mumbai.",agent
22,27:35:00,It is a US based company.,agent
22,27:37:00,So we have office in Bangalore but not in Mumbai.,agent
22,27:42:00,So you sit in Bangalore?,prospect
22,27:44:00,"Yes, I sit in Bangalore.",agent
22,27:47:00,"OK, yeah, OK.",prospect
22,27:49:00,You can go ahead with the video.,prospect
22,28:03:00,"One second, if you take this file, I will take you a couple of files.",agent
22,28:15:00,"So first thing that you are going to learn, you cannot hear the audio so you can just see it.",agent
22,28:21:00,So initially you are you are going to have an agenda of what you are going to study and what is the purpose of it.,agent
22,28:28:00,Here you have concept and summary where you would be navigating through.,agent
22,28:31:00,"So if it is, if it is particular thing, you are going to have this particular scenario.",agent
22,28:38:00,"So this is actually based on initially when you start, you are going to have a test.",agent
22,28:42:00,"If I start over, I will show you that we start with the test.",agent
22,28:46:00,The same thing.,agent
22,28:46:00,Let me open it for you.,agent
22,28:48:00,I will resume no.,agent
22,28:53:00,So you will have the agenda.,agent
22,28:55:00,"Once your agenda is done, you are going to click here.",agent
22,29:00:00,So with within within this you are going to have a question.,agent
22,29:07:00,You have to mark the right answer based on what you infer.,agent
22,29:09:00,So initially you are going to do it on your own and based on the right answers and wrong answers.,agent
22,29:14:00,"Suppose if I simply mark this based on how you solve this question, your video would be that length.",agent
22,29:20:00,"Suppose if you get all all right, your video would be really short.",agent
22,29:23:00,"But if you if you get all questions wrong, your video would be the longest.",agent
22,29:27:00,So that is that is what in terms of interactive video lessons means based on how you get or the feedback that you give accordingly you are you are going to have a review.,agent
22,29:38:00,So in this case you got only 2 right.,agent
22,29:44:00,Let me mute.,agent
22,29:46:00,Yeah.,agent
22,29:47:00,So you are going to have so your mentor is actually talking the back end.,agent
22,29:49:00,Its its your you know your subject what is actually talking the back end.,agent
22,29:54:00,So the audio is not there.,agent
22,29:55:00,"But see, for you to understand how we teach, checkout the free trial, which is there in the website.",agent
22,30:00:00,"So that would because you have to hear also, right?",agent
22,30:02:00,"If I just show you, yeah, you're just saying it, but is it right treatment for you and all these things that is possible only if you do it yourself.",agent
22,30:11:00,"So checkout the free trial, which is there in the platform, how checkout how we teach.",agent
22,30:16:00,"Are you comfortable with the teaching without in that case, good to go.",agent
22,30:20:00,"If not, it's your call.",agent
22,30:22:00,So that's what I recommend so that you can have a detailed understanding rather than me just showing it.,agent
22,30:29:00,So the idea behind the interactivity lesson is it is going to progress in terms of how you respond for this questions.,agent
22,30:35:00,"Everyday can be short, video can be long.",agent
22,30:36:00,"Here the estimated time is 35 minutes, but you took 36 minutes.",agent
22,30:40:00,"Here the estimated time is 35, recommended time is 35 minutes, you finish in 28 minutes.",agent
22,30:45:00,"Similarly here recommended time is 25 minutes, you finish in 2038 seconds, like 38 minutes here 40 minutes almost same time.",agent
22,30:52:00,"So depending upon your capability and your understanding, a video can be shorter or lengthy.",agent
22,31:02:00,"OK, so are there any free test also that you are giving?",prospect
22,31:08:00,We give one free mock.,agent
22,31:10:00,So 1 + 1 + 4I have or 1 + 5 mock test 1 + 4.,prospect
22,31:16:00,You can see one the first Test.,agent
22,31:17:00,We keep it open because you can suppose if you want you can create an alternate account just for the one mock.,agent
22,31:23:00,You can do that from there also.,agent
22,31:24:00,But generally we recommend that diagnostic quiz.,agent
22,31:27:00,The first mock is a diagnostic test to understand where your level is.,agent
22,31:30:00,"Then remaining 4 mocks to be kept at the end and the 2 free, you know GMAT mba.com mocks, you can use it towards end as well.",agent
22,31:39:00,"OK, So 1 + 45 + 2 that 7, Yeah.",prospect
22,31:48:00,"OK, So what is the fees?",prospect
22,31:50:00,How do you sell pay scores?,agent
22,31:53:00,"You are looking for 2 months, 4 months or 6 months?",agent
22,31:56:00,What's your idea?,agent
22,31:58:00,So how does it matter?,prospect
22,32:00:00,Duration matters.,agent
22,32:02:00,So suppose if you it's a subscription plan.,agent
22,32:03:00,"So if it is 2 months, you have access only till 2 months.",agent
22,32:07:00,So that how how do you know that?,agent
22,32:09:00,"If based on how you know what's your starting score is, you can take a free mock test.",agent
22,32:13:00,So that's what we tell you.,agent
22,32:16:00,You can take a free mock test based on your score.,agent
22,32:18:00,"We can recommend you, you know which one to choose twice on your score and mock test, it was between 400 to 450.",prospect
22,32:27:00,"If it is between 400 to 450, how many hours are on weekly basis can you give for your preparation?",agent
22,32:33:00,"Daily one hour and on Saturday, Sunday I can give you 2 to 4 to 5 + 99 hours.",prospect
22,32:39:00,9 to 10 hours you would you would require 6 months of time based on number of hours 4 you require 6 months of time.,agent
22,32:47:00,You give your mock score.,agent
22,32:48:00,I can create and share it with you because there is no replacement for that number of us.,agent
22,32:53:00,See based on your score.,agent
22,32:56:00,"Suppose let me just just creating for once and I would have created for you also if you had the score score I am telling you now 425 lets no, no just not just 425.",prospect
22,33:05:00,"I want your quant score, verbal score, DI score and your percentiles also in CRRCI want to know in detail to create it.",agent
22,33:12:00,"It is not just based on the total score, it is also based on suppose here we need to capture this data points.",agent
22,33:18:00,What is your starting scope for verbal?,agent
22,33:20:00,"What is your CR percentile, RC percentile, quants, percentile arithmetic, algebra, all these things that given lets me go back check if you have let me know now itself.",agent
22,33:35:00,We can see I have I have given an E GMAT only I don't know.,prospect
22,33:42:00,"OK, so just you just dictated to me then mock.",agent
22,33:56:00,"Alright, I will mock.",prospect
22,35:08:00,Do you wish to share your screen?,agent
22,35:09:00,I will help you navigate.,agent
22,35:13:00,"Yeah, I have to go to E GMAT right?",prospect
22,35:17:00,"You share your screen, I will help you navigate.",agent
22,35:38:00,"No, I have not taken on your portal.",prospect
22,35:41:00,I might have taken on mba.com.,prospect
22,35:44:00,"Okay, you can take from there.",agent
22,35:45:00,"In that case, that's okay enough for you.",prospect
22,35:49:00,"No, that's okay.",agent
22,35:57:00,mba.com free GMAT test.,prospect
22,35:59:00,I am writing it up.,prospect
22,37:05:00,We're not getting.,agent
22,37:06:00,Let's create a scenario and show it to you.,agent
22,37:11:00,"If you vaguely remember, let's put a scenario and do it.",agent
22,37:14:00,Yeah.,prospect
22,37:16:00,"OK, so what's your target score?",agent
22,37:20:00,710 Let's 710710 is equivalent to 665 focus.,prospect
22,37:27:00,Why means how you are saying this number I I don't know means check in mba.com understand your score.,prospect
22,37:32:00,You just have to Google it.,agent
22,37:33:00,It can just check it out in mba.com.,agent
22,37:36:00,Just type in you know understand your score from there you would see the test format has changed.,agent
22,37:42:00,So that's why it's a new format from 2023 yes yes yes so it's more harder you have it's harder it's harder yes yes so they have removed 1X means they have removed some I think sections.,prospect
22,37:58:00,"So now they have removed you do not have a sentence correction, you do not have analytical writing, you do not have algebra like within within quants, you do not have geometry.",agent
22,38:09:00,And there was something called IR section integrated listening that is removed and now new section is added data insights.,agent
22,38:17:00,"So, yeah, but they have increased the that account means what do you say the hardness of the test?",prospect
22,38:28:00,"Well, it does not to be honest, it does not matter because eventually earlier you it was more competitive even though it was easier.",agent
22,38:35:00,You need to get a 710.,agent
22,38:37:00,"That same amount of effort would take you here also to get a you know, 6710 is equivalent to 655 right now.",agent
22,38:45:00,"So, so in a way that is almost the same because you are competing, right?",agent
22,38:50:00,It is percentile and percentage.,agent
22,38:52:00,So that is why it is you know it is not going to affect you.,agent
22,38:56:00,The tough exam being tougher is gonna be exam being tougher for everyone.,agent
22,39:00:00,So you don't have to worry.,agent
22,39:03:00,OK yes.,prospect
22,39:04:00,So lets lets take a 730 kind of score.,agent
22,39:09:00,So 665 will take if that's OK 93rd percentile your current score is 400.,agent
22,39:17:00,What 4425 lets take 425.,prospect
22,39:23:00,"OK, so it was an mba.com test and that's put your verbal in a way what your score was Cipher verbal quant dot DI where was it high almost considered it as 70 707570 yeah.",prospect
22,39:56:00,Surukada 665 you have to get a sum of score of 83 on an average.,agent
22,40:01:00,So you need to get a 259 that is 838383 on an average.,agent
22,40:06:00,"Wherever there is deficit, there has to be surplus in the other section to compensate.",agent
22,40:10:00,So the sum of score you are chasing is 259249246 is 6.,agent
22,40:22:00,45 is equivalent to like 645 is you know you will get 645 when you have on average 828282 each in each other section on an average.,agent
22,40:32:00,So you would get a 645 if you get on average 838383 each you get an the score of 665 838383.,agent
22,40:43:00,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
22,40:47:00,OK.,agent
22,40:50:00,Just structuring your internal and just putting the cap wherever it applies.,agent
22,41:08:00,But how much time it will take to for me to you know that that would know once once we finalise and create this plan it see and could be a tentative GMAT tested.,prospect
22,41:22:00,So what is the number of hours you can give Monday to Friday?,agent
22,41:26:00,Lets take 11:50 hours Monday to Friday.,agent
22,41:30:00,"Friday daily one hour on Saturday, Sunday 22 hours 2 to 2.5 OK 22 hours on weekends is 9 hours of time.",prospect
22,41:52:00,"And when are you planning to start lets say on 15th January, OK to take time till 25th of September to get a target score of this which is way more because the time.",agent
22,42:09:00,So I will tell you why because there is no replacement for the time that you give either you have to increase your time or decrease your score.,agent
22,42:17:00,You have to go for a 645 kind of score.,agent
22,42:19:00,So this is something which is pretty accurate to the core.,agent
22,42:24:00,"So in terms of the time and plan your for your bubble, you take 101, 101 hours once around 18 hours and data insights you take around 82 hours from your current level.",agent
22,42:37:00,"OK, so I can give you my personal time.",prospect
22,42:40:00,"Sorry, sorry, sorry to interrupt you, but I have got the actual data.",prospect
22,42:46:00,Can I share my screen?,prospect
22,42:47:00,OK.,agent
22,42:49:00,"No, you can tell you can tell me.",agent
22,42:50:00,That's OK.,agent
22,42:50:00,"You, you.",agent
22,42:51:00,"No, no, I am not understanding.",prospect
22,42:53:00,You can only analyse and let me know where is your this is one conversation.,prospect
22,43:02:00,Sorry teams.,prospect
22,43:05:00,"OK, I can share my screen, correct?",prospect
22,43:08:00,So I have shared my screen yeah.,prospect
22,43:14:00,Where is the new window?,prospect
22,43:16:00,Can you see?,prospect
22,43:18:00,"Yeah, I can see 455.",agent
22,43:22:00,"Okay, so cons data and science verbal 707573.",prospect
22,43:33:00,"Okay, so it is going to be just minor difference you would be finishing it in you know towards you know starting of August maybe one month difference you would have because we have taken 425 and Quans is also you know 35th percentile.",agent
22,43:49:00,So you would you would take time to go from that because the target score that we are taking is close to 90th percentile in each of the section.,agent
22,43:57:00,"So you take if you are, if either you have to increase your number of hours from 9 hours to 15 hours, 50 hours, in that case it will be different.",agent
22,44:06:00,"Otherwise you, you take this time.",agent
22,44:09:00,"OK, what if I go with the live sessions maybe one month here and there extra that you know you did go faster.",prospect
22,44:20:00,But see I am not telling see for you to take a 6 months course.,agent
22,44:23:00,I am just telling your reality be it be it easy mat or be it outside.,agent
22,44:27:00,There is a scale metrics with which you take some particular time.,agent
22,44:30:00,So you have to boost up your number of hours of time commitments in terms of a prep.,agent
22,44:34:00,"You have to increase it considering your score, you have to increase it to say 15 hours, 20 hours.",agent
22,44:40:00,"There is no option if you are actually if you really want to do it in say you know 4 months of time, you have to increase your, you know time almost level.",agent
22,44:50:00,"So because the number of hours which is there, there is no replacement.",agent
22,44:55:00,"So see I can be you know I can, I can I could have told you some but that OK 4 months would be enough you just purchase but that will be unrealistic expectations what has been said.",agent
22,45:05:00,So I have to show you the reality.,agent
22,45:07:00,Let us do one thing if I take now 4 months course and if it does not contain I can extend to 2 months more that is OK you can you can extend it to 2 months more.,prospect
22,45:15:00,You can start with 2 months also you can send it to the same price.,agent
22,45:19:00,It will be $89 extra for each of the month.,agent
22,45:24:00,So so means let us suppose what is your price of 18 month course?,prospect
22,45:30:00,"Sorry 6 month course for 6 months course right now it is $399 which is 34,000.",agent
22,45:37:00,We have some discounts also running.,agent
22,45:40:00,"So you would get it for say 27,027, 1000.",agent
22,45:43:00,So what is the price of 4 month course?,prospect
22,45:47:00,"It is actually $299 which is around 26,500, but with discount you are going to get it for 21,000, 21 and 27.",agent
22,45:56:00,"OK, let's suppose now the 21,000 crores I take and I want to extend for 2 months more.",prospect
22,46:02:00,"So you told me $18 more you're gonna pay $89, $89, 89.",agent
22,46:07:00,So it will be around 7500 more per month.,agent
22,46:12:00,So it comes around the same figure.,agent
22,46:16:00,"It's coming more, right?",prospect
22,46:18:00,"21,000 + 7500 is 28,500 for 5 months and then again 7500 is 36,000 where 6 months directly if you purchase in this exactly 27,000.",prospect
22,46:29:00,So but The thing is you can decide if to go for if you are able to finish in 4 months you will be saving that is the benefit if you finish the course in 4 months if you are able to do that you will be saving your money if not you have even more price.,agent
22,46:44:00,So you will be giving me this course no Means you won't be giving me this the same amount if I don't take the 6 month course correct?,prospect
22,46:55:00,"If I want to extend 21,000 crores I have to bear the loss correct?",prospect
22,47:00:00,I won't get it in the same amount of the 6 month course.,prospect
22,47:04:00,The thing is we allow a small window of 1015 days of purchase.,agent
22,47:09:00,Suppose you purchased you know within 1015 days.,agent
22,47:13:00,"If you are able to come back to us and say that hey, no, I want to pay the difference and take the 6 months that happens but not after 4 months then on the extension is there then yes, you would have to during the course on the 3rd month.",agent
22,47:25:00,"If I decide then no, most probably not That depends on the support team there.",prospect
22,47:31:00,"You know, it depends on that situation, particular situation, but you need not consider.",agent
22,47:36:00,"I don't want to promise you may happen, but it is it is something which which I don't want to promise you because generally don't generally if you don't do the you know, pay the difference then but yeah, OK, because the amount you are saying is very high or considering the sale pay score because I have I have been interacting with other if you remember, no IMSIMS something like that.",agent
22,48:06:00,"So they are giving me a live session of 3 months and means the same amount that you are saying 34, 35,000 but the live session you can check their results.",prospect
22,48:19:00,"So the to be honest what I am telling is it does not say in in your case if you are taking live course if that is better for you, you can go for that.",agent
22,48:28:00,But the idea is here the kind of analytics and the mental support that you are getting.,agent
22,48:33:00,I am doubtful if batch is something which works for you like you want to be enrolled.,agent
22,48:37:00,It is a one on one session that you are going to get for 3 months.,prospect
22,48:40:00,"Yes, yes, they will be giving me 93030 minute sessions, one on one.",prospect
22,48:47:00,"So OK, apart from the live session, so 15 hours, 15 hours of live, right?",agent
22,48:53:00,"No, no, the live session will go on everyday.",prospect
22,48:56:00,"But apart from that, if you want to have a doubt session, if you have 510 doubts, you can schedule a 30 minute call, like 30 minute call or one will be one on one apart from the live sessions, OK, yeah, so it is very interactive.",prospect
22,49:10:00,You know I can ask right away if I have 10 questions.,prospect
22,49:13:00,"I am solving it out if I 10 curries, I will schedule a call and then solve it right away instead of, you know, chatting in the box and you can you can see the idea is we just tell you what we offer in terms of what is the offering so that you can take an informed decision.",prospect
22,49:30:00,"If you feel that that is more aligned with your case, you can go with that.",agent
22,49:35:00,But see what are the reason I was telling is so you just have to compare the results.,agent
22,49:39:00,"So taking a lesson can anybody can do, but what is the result?",agent
22,49:43:00,"How many you know, result got published, not the brochure that they give, but in the actual scenario in public market, we cannot lie, right?",agent
22,49:52:00,"So their their YouTube channel, they also will have just checkout the result.",agent
22,49:55:00,So accordingly you will see the difference in that.,agent
22,49:59:00,"But yeah, if live class is something you want to go with, you have to go with that.",agent
22,50:06:00,So that's that's as simple as that.,agent
22,50:08:00,But what I the purpose of this call is to help you understand what we offer and accordingly you can take a choice.,agent
22,50:13:00,What works best for you can take a choice.,agent
22,50:17:00,So tell me the last amount that you will do for 4 and 6 month course.,prospect
22,50:21:00,"Can you come on for the 6 month course for up to 21,000?",prospect
22,50:25:00,"No, we have standard discounts.",agent
22,50:27:00,So $80 discount is what you get from a $399.,agent
22,50:31:00,You are going to get a discount of $80 which is $319.,agent
22,50:35:00,"That is what the price is and that will be around 27,000.",agent
22,50:40:00,You cannot go beyond that.,prospect
22,50:42:00,"No, no, we have standard pricing in terms of the offers.",agent
22,50:45:00,"When we give discounts, you know, we have the standard pricing.",agent
22,50:48:00,We never have gone up or down.,agent
22,50:50:00,So we do not have a price of say $319 or 6 months.,agent
22,50:53:00,We with discounts you are going to get it for $319.,agent
22,50:56:00,We have never sold for $345.,agent
22,50:58:00,"Also we have never sold for, you know $281 or $285 also.",agent
22,51:03:00,It is always a standard price.,agent
22,51:05:00,So yeah.,agent
22,51:16:00,OK.,prospect
22,51:17:00,"So yes, I think that's it then.",prospect
22,51:20:00,"Then it's a final price then now OK, from your side it's a yes or no, correct?",prospect
22,51:27:00,"Yeah, yeah, it's, it's the same, you know, pricing that you know we have.",agent
22,51:32:00,"So yes, that's the standard pricing that we have, yeah.",agent
22,51:41:00,"Any tax GST or additional or 27,000 if you if you pay by a card you are gonna be paid 27 you will be paying 27,000.",prospect
22,51:50:00,But if you want to use Google Pay to do net banking you would have 18% GST.,agent
22,51:56:00,Government regulation.,agent
22,51:56:00,So if you are paying via card because the company is waste out of US you don't have any extra charges coming by.,agent
22,52:03:00,"You are going to get it for 27,000 including everything around 27,000 $1000 if you have a card like which which allows international transaction like visa card, visa credit card or something of that sort.",agent
22,52:18:00,If you have you can you can get it.,agent
22,52:20:00,If not it will be 18% GST on top if you want to pay by Google Pay.,agent
22,52:27:00,OK at Max.,prospect
22,52:27:00,Can you do the 4 month course extension for 5 months to me?,prospect
22,52:33:00,I am just asking you the possibility so that I can decide based on my 4 month course.,prospect
22,52:40:00,You can give me a thank you 5 months for the same amount.,prospect
22,52:45:00,"So see you know one thing which I had like to tell you is see don't I understand that you really want to do it, but you know it's a standard pricing which is not in my hands.",agent
22,52:55:00,Also the one thing which you can do is I can give you that coupon code for discount.,agent
22,53:00:00,That's the standard pricing.,agent
22,53:01:00,Otherwise if I have to do something I have to do from my pocket.,agent
22,53:03:00,So that's that's the thing we don't do that right.,agent
22,53:05:00,It doesn't make sense.,agent
22,53:06:00,"So the coupon code extra coupon code apart from the that you are giving me standard discount apart from that no, that discount is in coupon code.",prospect
22,53:16:00,I will be sharing your if you look at our website you will find $399.,agent
22,53:21:00,So we don't have discounts.,agent
22,53:22:00,"No, no, I am OK with that.",prospect
22,53:23:00,Let's suppose I am just assuming I am trying to get the most of out of it so that I can make an informed decision with 23 comparison of the different companies.,prospect
22,53:32:00,So I am asking you OK if I take the 4 month course I don't want to decrease the amount.,prospect
22,53:38:00,Lets suppose I just want to add up one month extra.,prospect
22,53:41:00,"In case I don't finish my that course in 4 months, can you give it to me one month extra?",prospect
22,53:50:00,"In the same you are saying you want to pay 26,500 for 4 months?",agent
22,53:54:00,"No 21 only I will be paying, but can you give me the 4 month course for 5 months?",prospect
22,53:59:00,"No, we cannot do that.",agent
22,54:01:00,We cannot you know do that unfortunately.,agent
22,54:04:00,So that's what I was telling you.,agent
22,54:05:00,It will be standard pricing of $89 for each of the extra month.,agent
22,54:09:00,"That's how it will be if if it is 15 days, it will be $49.",agent
22,54:14:00,"If it is for one month, it will be $89.",agent
22,54:16:00,So that's how it is going to be.,agent
22,54:20:00,"OK, fine.",prospect
22,54:21:00,"Yeah, OK.",prospect
22,54:23:00,Thank you.,prospect
22,54:24:00,"Yeah, Alright, see you then.",agent
22,54:26:00,Yep.,agent
22,54:28:00,"Bye, hi.",prospect
47,00:02,So far you've not taken any marks.,agent
47,00:04,"The test date that you have in mind is about March and April, so we'll see how long we take to get done with that.",agent
47,00:11,"You're actually looking for top six goals in the US, but if that doesn't happen, but still US is where you want to be.",agent
47,00:19,"And for test prep material from December, you enrolled in the Bouche, but then you know, New Year's came and of course all the party season that happens in your country, you have gotten it frozen, but the subscription is still on.",agent
47,00:35,"When it comes to pain points, you've, you really feel that want is something that you find challenging because you're not able to all the time figure out what exactly the question is asking.",agent
47,00:45,Verbal is still handleable by you and you feel that DI will not pose a problem as soon as quant and verbal are taken care of.,agent
47,00:53,So we are right on track with all of that.,agent
47,00:57,"And so now what I'm going to do, , is that I'm going to create a study plan for you, which is going to tell us that how long is it going to take for you to prepare and get to so that score of 685.",agent
47,01:13,"So I'm going to OK, create your study plan and I'm going to share my screen with you right away here.",agent
47,01:27,"And so you'll be able to OK, see my screen.",agent
47,01:30,I was making this planner for somebody else.,agent
47,01:33,So let me just go ahead and let's just say delete.,agent
47,01:40,And so you've not given any mocks.,agent
47,01:43,"No, nothing, right?",agent
47,01:44,You don't know exactly where your ability stands.,agent
47,01:47,"So OK, let me just no, create a mock study plan for you.",agent
47,01:50,"And let's start a little humble because we know that, you know, maybe we can be in a in a shorter range.",agent
47,01:57,And so target is 685.,agent
47,02:00,This we know.,agent
47,02:02,"Yeah, starting ability.",agent
47,02:03,Where would you say how much percentile would you be in if you were to write a mock right now?,agent
47,02:15,"Maybe I think it will be somewhere between 555 fifty, something like that.",prospect
47,02:23,"550 OK, so let's start with 545.",agent
47,02:26,"Let's say that you are at 5:45, which is 43rd percentile and you still need to work your way up.",agent
47,02:33,Say you took a Sigma X mark and from 5:54 we are moving to 684.,agent
47,02:39,"So we are looking for that 145 forty 140 point improvement, which is absolutely doable.",agent
47,02:46,No issues on that.,agent
47,02:48,"Now let's say you said, hey, you know what, my verbal is very good.",agent
47,02:52,So let's keep you to 79 in verbal 1.,agent
47,02:56,"I, I, I get it, but I really don't get it all the single time.",agent
47,03:01,So let me put it slightly lower on 73 and data insights.,agent
47,03:07,Let let's keep it at 77.,agent
47,03:10,OK.,agent
47,03:10,"Is quant too low or is that, does that look OK?",agent
47,03:13,"No, I think, I think it's OK.",prospect
47,03:14,I think it's OK.,agent
47,03:15,So let's just go with this and let's see.,agent
47,03:21,So this is where our planner is taking us.,agent
47,03:24,The planner very well identifies that you are doing pretty well with verbal.,agent
47,03:29,"So to get to that 685, we will take you to 85th verbal, we'll take you to 87 quant and we'll take you to data Insights 80.",agent
47,03:38,Now as you are progressing in your course  and we see that you have come to a point where you are able to handle data insights well or we can push you a little bit more in verbal.,agent
47,03:50,Then what what we would try to do is that decrease that pressure of getting to Q87 from you so that we can actually leverage on your strength and push you where the the scores are coming more easily for us rather than you know kind of working really hard to really get to that Q87.,agent
47,04:11,"OK, So these scores are dynamic.",agent
47,04:15,We will change it according to the performance that you do while you are on the course.,agent
47,04:21,Makes sense.,prospect
47,04:21,"OK, Yeah.",prospect
47,04:23,OK.,agent
47,04:24,So let's move on now.,agent
47,04:25,"We will take subsectional scores also if we are looking at D85, then sorry V-85, then where is that 85 coming from?",agent
47,04:37,"Whether we are, we need to target more on your CR or whether on RC again depending upon the idea is to leverage on your strengths as much as we can.",agent
47,04:46,"So we are looking at that you know, almost 6 point improvement in verbal.",agent
47,04:52,"The the youth, the largest improvement that we are looking at isn't quant definitely that's 14 points and data insights just about 3 points.",agent
47,05:00,"So now when you've seen verbal already for some time now, are you better than CR or better than RC?",agent
47,05:07,What would you say RC?,prospect
47,05:12,I think RC are better than CRD.,prospect
47,05:13,Yeah.,agent
47,05:14,"OK, so let's take it to say about, OK, it won't go beyond 58, so I'm just going to keep it there and let's just see that I keep it over here for CR.",agent
47,05:25,"OK, let's work with that.",agent
47,05:30,So 4.3 weeks for that and let's proceed in.,agent
47,05:37,"I think right now this question won't make much sense, so let's just stick to this, whatever optimum we are getting from the planner, OK, so 5.6 weeks now, 5.6 weeks is coming from the fact that you're putting 20 weeks per hour Monday through Friday, you're giving two hours because then you're working and Saturday, Sunday because you're off, you're thinking that you could do at least five hours of study.",agent
47,06:03,So 10 hours coming from the weekdays and 10 hours coming from your weekend.,agent
47,06:06,"That's making it 20 hours and OK, makes sense.",prospect
47,06:10,Alrighty.,agent
47,06:11,And then when we go to proceed it start with this.,agent
47,06:15,It'll keep our DI.,agent
47,06:19,Let's see here.,agent
47,06:22,"Let's see here MSR, we can take chance with this.",agent
47,06:27,"OK, So about 4.6 weeks.",agent
47,06:32,So 6 + 6 plus almost 5.,agent
47,06:35,That's what I'm looking at.,agent
47,06:36,"OK, let's.",agent
47,06:37,So we are going to start with verbal and then we are going to take you to quant and then DI.,agent
47,06:45,"DI will always be your last section because as you said, either they are asking map based question or non map based questions.",agent
47,06:52,"Once you're done with both of them, handing them would be easier.",agent
47,06:56,This is the time commitment that the planner is taking.,agent
47,06:59,Do you think that you'll be able to stick to this?,agent
47,07:03,"Yeah, yeah, maybe I'll maybe I'll study more in Saturday and Sunday, but I think it's OK.",prospect
47,07:08,Five hours both and two hours during the week.,prospect
47,07:10,I think's OK.,prospect
47,07:11,Yeah.,agent
47,07:11,OK.,agent
47,07:12,"So, yeah, so you will get that option to increase anytime in case you can study more.",agent
47,07:18,So we will look into that as well.,agent
47,07:20,"Now, Fernando, your day has already started.",agent
47,07:23,You must have plans for today.,agent
47,07:25,"Suppose if you start starting from tomorrow, you know like you fix that schedule that OK, these two hours are coming gonna come from here, then when we will be able to take the test Actually it will take you to may end of Yeah, because that's the kind of time we require unless we increase time over here.",agent
47,07:46,"But since you would be working, I would suggest not to burn your candle on both sides.",agent
47,07:52,It's OK because the schools will only open their round one somewhere in July.,agent
47,08:00,"So if you're yeah, if you're getting done with your test by 28 May still you will OK have to put 45454045 days to work on your application and the and the deadline is only on September.",agent
47,08:13,So I think I correct the deadline.,prospect
47,08:15,I have more time exactly.,agent
47,08:17,That also makes a lot of sense that the deadline is also gonna be in September.,agent
47,08:21,"So rather than let's just focus on the first thing first, which is Gmail test.",agent
47,08:25,"Get that done with, let's get that good score and then we can start worrying about our application.",agent
47,08:35,"OK, so let's just accept all these suggestions that's coming from the study plan.",agent
47,08:41,And now I'm going to show you what your calendar looks like.,agent
47,08:44,So this is what your calendar is going to look like.,agent
47,08:46,"You're going to spend some 7 hours in an additional course other than CRNRC, which we have in verbal.",agent
47,08:52,And I'll tell you why we have an extra course and what you need to do in that.,agent
47,08:56,Then your verbal will start with stage 1.,agent
47,08:59,"So every single subsection you will complete in two stages, Stage 1 and stage 2.",agent
47,09:06,So RC also is happening in Stage 1 and in stage 2.,agent
47,09:11,"Once both the subsections are done, then we will take you to verbal test readiness, which is nothing but sectional mocks.",agent
47,09:18,"So now we're going to put together everything and we're going to see your ability, whether you're getting to that target score that study planner has set for you.",agent
47,09:24,Quant is going to be the same thing.,agent
47,09:26,You're going to start with some basics and then our and let me take you to the course over here.,agent
47,09:34,Hear you understand it better.,agent
47,09:35,"So verbal apart from CR and RC, we have an extra course, which is master comprehension, which appears as MC in your course.",agent
47,09:43,I'm gonna talk about it.,agent
47,09:43,What what it is Quant Quant basics It is.,agent
47,09:47,"First we will go through the quant basics to understand that OK, what are the basic concepts that are tested on Gmap and how do they work?",agent
47,09:55,"Then number properties, word problems, and advanced topics are the three topics under arithmetic.",agent
47,10:04,"So little tedious, but these are the three sections in arithmetic and algebra is just algebra.",agent
47,10:10,"There are fewer topics over here, so we can cover it all by itself.",agent
47,10:14,Data insights.,agent
47,10:15,"All the four sections that you are aware of, they are all covered pretty comprehensively.",agent
47,10:20,"One thing that remains constant throughout the three sections are the three stages of learning, which is the basic architecture of teaching at EG math.",agent
47,10:31,In stage one we teach you all the concepts and the processes.,agent
47,10:35,"In stage 2 we take you to medium and hard level questions where you work on your accuracy and you know, cementing your process that you have learned in stage 1.",agent
47,10:47,"And finally, we take you to test readiness where we'll we give you sectional marks just to make sure that you are getting to the target which the planner has set for you.",agent
47,10:58,"Once everything is done right at the last week of the test of of your preparation, we are just going to give you 4 full length marks.",agent
47,11:07,"So in on GMAT, we have on at egmap platform, we have 5 mops altogether.",agent
47,11:15,The first one is free of cost for you.,agent
47,11:17,You can take it even before purchasing the course.,agent
47,11:20,This just helps us create your own personalized study plan because then we can get to know what is your starting ability.,agent
47,11:27,"OK, so then we will know whether it's really you are at 4:45 or maybe you you could be a little higher than that, maybe you're really doing OK, things like that.",agent
47,11:36,"And So what will happen is that if you score more than the days taken in, the planner is also gonna come.",agent
47,11:43,Yeah.,prospect
47,11:44,So probably we will not have to wait till May end to write the test.,agent
47,11:47,"Maybe we would be able to write the test in second week of May, who knows?",agent
47,11:50,Then we would have more time to work on our application.,agent
47,11:53,So that's the whole purpose of it.,agent
47,11:55,"But the last four mocks we will reserve till the end of your course preparation so that just before you book your test, we will put you into that momentum of writing one mock every single day so that you can decide on your section.",agent
47,12:08,"You can feel the exam anxiety, how much it's coming and bothering you or your you're comfortable with your test, so on and so forth.",agent
47,12:15,"OK, so OK, all the planning related to the real test will happen during your mocks, which is the last stage of your studies.",agent
47,12:24,"OK, so now when we wait, I just need to move this far here.",agent
47,12:35,"OK, so now let's go to our course.",agent
47,12:39,"If I show you your planner, according to your planner, the first thing you're starting is with MC course, which is Master comprehensions.",agent
47,12:48,"And so in Master comprehension course, Master comprehension is nothing, but it's a skill building course.",agent
47,12:56,"It's an additional course which is not tested under GMAT, but , by the way, I am a senior verbal SME at EGMAP.",agent
47,13:04,"I've been working with GMAP for the last 13 1/2 years and I'm primarily a verbal SME, but now I doubled up as a strategist as well.",agent
47,13:13,"So you know, when we created our CR and that time SCRC and CR, all the three courses, we realized that there's a lot of reading and understanding that you have to do in the world of verbal.",agent
47,13:25,"And so we thought that my not to teach our students the first thing first, which is how to read properly.",agent
47,13:31,"Because if we don't read properly, then we do not engage with the passage well.",agent
47,13:37,"And if we don't engage with the passage well, then of course, you know, there is a snowball effect and then we can't actually answer our questions.",agent
47,13:45,"So the idea of this core building skill course is that we teach you how to read in small, small chunks so that you read and comprehend at the same time, basically making you an active leader.",agent
47,13:57,"When you become an active leader, your understanding of the passive increases by 80%.",agent
47,14:02,That's the first thing.,agent
47,14:03,The second thing that happens is that your retention is more because you have been actively reading everything in the passage.,agent
47,14:09,"So you remember, OK, I read this, I read that.",agent
47,14:11,And the third thing that happens is your recall is faster because you have been that engaged and then your recall improves.,agent
47,14:20,Then what happens is that you don't have to go back to passage and really did to answer every single question.,agent
47,14:27,That means saving a huge amount of time on exam.,agent
47,14:32,"And this skill will come very, very handy in DI also because DI questions are super lengthy to read.",agent
47,14:38,"They're just very, very verbose.",agent
47,14:41,"And then once you become a manager too, the skill will come when you will come handy when you start reading, say, news reports and you know, case studies on at your job.",agent
47,14:54,So a life skill to get.,agent
47,14:57,Now let's start with Verbal.,agent
47,15:00,"OK, so in verbal for both CR and RC, our first module is the Foundation Concepts.",agent
47,15:08,"In CR, the first thing that we do is we teach you how to identify a conclusion in in ACR argument because that's the most important part of the argument because most of the questions centered around conclusion.",agent
47,15:23,"Once you learn that the following modules map to the kind of CR questions that you face on G Nat, which are six types inference, assumption, evaluates, trend, then beacon and boldface.",agent
47,15:37,"These are the major categories that we look at, OK?",agent
47,15:42,"So after that, we basically we tell our students to focus more on module and assumptions because if these two modules you're able to master inference will help you master strengthen and weaken because they are nothing but inference questions with a little specificity that OK, find the strengthener for the conclusion or find the weakener for the.",agent
47,16:03,"So these are all inferences, but nothing else.",agent
47,16:05,"And then if you learn whatever you're learning in assumptions, that will help you answer, evaluate and boldface.",agent
47,16:12,You just need the same skills.,agent
47,16:13,So assumption will fill that up for you.,agent
47,16:16,And So what do we have in inference?,agent
47,16:18,There are 14 lessons now.,agent
47,16:21,They are not randomly put there.,agent
47,16:23,There is a structure to every module.,agent
47,16:25,Also three parts to every module.,agent
47,16:28,"In the first part of the module, you learn all the necessary concepts that you need to know to answer inference questions correctly.",agent
47,16:36,"And mind you, out of these 14 files, only 5 are lessons.",agent
47,16:41,Rest all the 9 are nothing but quiz files.,agent
47,16:44,Yes they are quiz practice files right?,prospect
47,16:48,And in fact every single lesson also they start with a small quiz and they end with a mini quiz to make sure.,agent
47,16:56,Basically to give you the feedback as to how well you have learned that particular lesson like we would have in school.,agent
47,17:02,You know they would administer on small tests just like that.,agent
47,17:06,OK.,agent
47,17:07,The second part of the module is the application file where we teach you the three-step process to solve every single CR question.,agent
47,17:15,And then we take you to the practice files where you marry the applications with the concepts and now apply them on GMAP light question.,agent
47,17:25,"With every next practice file that you move on to, the questions start becoming complicated more.",agent
47,17:32,"And so we basically we are working on your ability to 1st apply concepts and application on easier questions, then on medium questions and then on part questions.",agent
47,17:43,Do you have any questions at this point?,agent
47,17:45,"No, no.",prospect
47,17:47,Looks OK Makes sense.,prospect
47,17:49,"Looks OK, makes sense.",agent
47,17:50,"OK, so now you can see that there are certain score against each and every lesson that we have.",agent
47,17:57,These are all scores of your quizzes that you would be attempting in every lesson.,agent
47,18:02,"Now you may ask, hey, what is a good score?",agent
47,18:05,Do I need to get 100% in every single file?,agent
47,18:08,"No, not really.",agent
47,18:10,Just stay above the median.,agent
47,18:12,"Then you will be good and then you can ask me, OK, So what is the median score?",agent
47,18:17,So right now we are looking at the course in the modules where there is something called Journey view.,agent
47,18:23,"Also when we do the journey view, we don't see the modules, we see the learning lessons and we see that we get grades over here.",agent
47,18:30,"OK, so if you click on Foundation CR and you click on activity performance, the first foundation module and the inference module are part of this.",agent
47,18:41,"And if you check the median score over here, everything is mentioned here.",agent
47,18:47,"If you score more than the median, that's when you get grade A.",agent
47,18:53,"If you score equal to the median, you get grade B.",agent
47,18:57,"Anything below the median will get you grade C, which is a big red flag.",agent
47,19:02,"If you get grade C, What you need to do is look at the question that you got wrong.",agent
47,19:07,"Look at the solution, compare it with your process that what you did to get the answer wrong.",agent
47,19:12,"If needed, go back to that pertinent portion in that video lesson where that particular topic has been taught so that you know what mistake you made and you know how to fix it.",agent
47,19:23,"So that when you move on to the next lesson and attempt the next quiz, you do not make the same mistake.",agent
47,19:30,"But do you think that do you think that in this moment where I'm still learning and doing this first quizzes, I should get concerned about the time that I take him to answer the question I or should concern about getting it right, getting it right?",prospect
47,19:44,Because you will see none of our questions are timed.,agent
47,19:47,"None of our quizzes are timed anyway, so that's a very good question to ask .",agent
47,19:53,"Stage one, we will only focus on learning things the right way and getting to that accuracy.",agent
47,20:01,We are not working on time time.,agent
47,20:03,We will work on Stage 2 and Stage 3.,agent
47,20:06,Nice OK right and and you will find that none of these quizzes have any time timer on them.,prospect
47,20:11,"You can take as long as you want, but we want you to get those grade A's.",agent
47,20:16,"So grades, that's why we are looking at try to take get as many A's as possible.",agent
47,20:21,"OK, so this is where you can come and check how much grade have you gotten?",agent
47,20:25,"And there you need help Now, , if you decide to come on on board, EG Mat, you will be provided a mentor with whom you can communicate through emails.",agent
47,20:35,"Say if you get stuck with, you know, grade C in one of the files or two of the files, and you say, hey, I was doing pretty good.",agent
47,20:42,Could you just take a look at those two lessons and my quizzes and let me know why did I score grade C?,agent
47,20:49,Because I'm really not able to wrap my head around it and tell me what's the what's the solution to get back up to grade A again?,agent
47,20:57,So they will help you navigate through the course also.,agent
47,21:01,"OK, OK.",agent
47,21:01,"And so come, we'll come back to that.",agent
47,21:04,"This is the way you will finish inference assumption evaluates from then and all of that, you know, and as you keep moving, the modules will start getting shorter and shorter because most of the things you have already covered in inference and assumption.",agent
47,21:17,"So rest of them just introduction to these type of question and nothing else, but just get getting into the practice of all of that.",agent
47,21:26,"OK, then we have the last module for you, some miscellaneous kind of questions that you may see here and there, but we we just have it so that you're at least familiar with that.",agent
47,21:36,"Once this module is done, you have spent enough time, about 41 hours on your CR stage 1.",agent
47,21:45,Stage 1 is done.,agent
47,21:47,Any questions before I take you to stage C?,agent
47,21:50,Stage two?,agent
47,21:51,"No, no, it's OK.",prospect
47,21:53,OK.,agent
47,21:53,Mm hmm.,agent
47,21:54,Now it's time to work on your accuracy and timing both.,agent
47,22:02,"OK, now we will come to the timed quiz where we will see whether the process has become intuitive to you or not.",agent
47,22:09,So this is our quizzing platform which we call Scholaranium.,agent
47,22:14,We are at Verbal Scholaranium.,agent
47,22:15,Now you have just finished your CR course and now we will take you to our stage 2 which we call cementing quizzes.,agent
47,22:23,Cementing quizzes have been have been divided into two parts Medium cementing and hard cementing.,agent
47,22:30,So how do we clear medium cementing?,agent
47,22:32,We ask you to take 5 quizzes.,agent
47,22:35,"These quizzes are short ones, five to six questions each, not nothing too demanding.",agent
47,22:40,So we ask you to take 5 quizzes and at least three of them must have 70% or more accuracy.,agent
47,22:50,That's your threshold to get past three.,agent
47,22:53,And these are timed quizzes mind you.,agent
47,22:55,"So we will look into your accuracy as well, your timing aspect as well.",agent
47,23:00,"OK, once you get the, then once we get that graph that OK, we see three dots over this broken green line.",agent
47,23:07,We know you have cleared your medium cementing.,agent
47,23:10,You are ready to move on to your hard cementing.,agent
47,23:13,Now questions will become harder.,agent
47,23:15,"Mind you, , we are looking at 685, which is 96 percentile and in order to get to that score, we actually need to face more medium and harder questions.",agent
47,23:27,Easier questions will not cut it for us.,agent
47,23:30,"OK, so it's important that we get accuracy in our medium and hard questions.",agent
47,23:34,"OK, then we take you to hard, hard cementing again the same drill 5 quizzes, but three, at least three must have more than 55% accuracy.",agent
47,23:47,"So again, above the dotted line we you need to see three dots at least over here for your OK cementing to be done.",agent
47,23:56,"So this way you would have done 50, sorry 10 quizzes over here, about 50 to 60 questions.",agent
47,24:05:00,Only in stage 260 questions are good enough to get that process cemented that you are that you have learnt in stage 1.,agent
47,24:14:00,"Think about when you went, you know, maybe say driving.",agent
47,24:18:00,"You know, there were so many things to work on the first day.",agent
47,24:21:00,"Hand eye coordination, look at your mirrors, look at your rearview mirror, maintain your lane.",agent
47,24:26:00,Not swirling around here with a lot.,agent
47,24:28:00,"But you know, once you started driving more and more and more, you started with a small empty parking lot.",agent
47,24:33:00,Then we started going onto our local roads and finally onto the highways.,agent
47,24:37:00,So we built up our ability slowly.,agent
47,24:39:00,That's exactly what we are doing in stage one.,agent
47,24:42:00,We will give you all the ability to navigate when we bring you to Scholaranium.,agent
47,24:47:00,Here we are letting you lose first in your in your city streets and then taking you to the hub.,agent
47,24:54:00,That's OK Nice of doing this.,prospect
47,24:56:00,OK.,agent
47,24:56:00,"Now once your CR is done, we will go back to the course and we will finish our reading comprehension in exactly the same manner.",agent
47,25:05:00,"Our first module is very, very important over here where you learn strategies, how to remain engaged even with the harder passages with certain strategies.",agent
47,25:15:00,"It's like note taking, looking at the keywords, following the transition, and following what the author is trying to tell us through this passage.",agent
47,25:25:00,"OK, this is the most important one over here.",agent
47,25:28:00,Make sure that you you get all the grade grades A over here.,agent
47,25:33:00,And then the next 4-1 are the four different kinds of RC questions that you see.,agent
47,25:38:00,Nothing too much to worry about over here.,agent
47,25:41:00,"These are really shorter concepts we just introduce you to OK, this is how detailed question are worded.",agent
47,25:48:00,This is where you need to work on if your detailed question comes and other steps related to that.,agent
47,25:54:00,"Then we will bring you to the application file of RC where we will serve you 9 passages starting with four easy, then taking you to 5 medium and we will round up stage one with seven hard passages.",agent
47,26:10:00,SO16 passages starting from easy ending with hard in your first stage as well.,agent
47,26:18:00,"OK, OK, once again, criteria is there.",prospect
47,26:21:00,Stay above medium.,agent
47,26:23:00,Get grade A in all of these.,agent
47,26:26:00,"OK, once this is done, it's time to move on to Stage 2 and Stage 2.",agent
47,26:31:00,"Once again, the cementing criteria throughout every subsection remain the same.",agent
47,26:38:00,"For medium 3, cementing with 70% or more, hard cementing at least three of them with 55% or that's all we require.",agent
47,26:46:00,"OK, Once you have done that also for RC, you've solved some 100 to 140 questions only in your Stage 2 combining CR and RC.",agent
47,26:55:00,"Now it's time to take you to Stage 3 of verbal, which is sectional mock.",agent
47,27:01:00,"So we will give you only the verbal sectional mock 45 minutes, 23 questions.",agent
47,27:06:00,"Let's see how far, how close we we have come to the target set by our planner.",agent
47,27:11:00,"OK, OK.",prospect
47,27:12:00,"And yeah, So there are 50 sectional box all across the board, 15 for DI, 15 for verbal and 15 for content, 5 here and there.",agent
47,27:22:00,"So we have ample mock tests, sectional mock tests to Ray Tube.",agent
47,27:27:00,Any questions?,agent
47,27:29:00,"No, no, makes sense.",prospect
47,27:31:00,"Really, really clear.",prospect
47,27:32:00,"Oh, OK, so now we will.",agent
47,27:34:00,"So now that your verbal is over, we will get you started with quant and your drill will remain absolutely the same.",agent
47,27:42:00,"You will first go through stage one in quant, Quant basics.",agent
47,27:49:00,"Here we will just help you brush up a simple, some simple concepts that you might see going forward.",agent
47,27:59:00,"Now I want to talk about one feature that we have only in our contours, nowhere else.",agent
47,28:05:00,It's called Pace View engine.,agent
47,28:07:00,Now Pace View Engine what because point course is very tedious.,agent
47,28:11:00,We have 3 sections only for arithmetic and they are pretty long thing.,agent
47,28:15:00,And let me take you to one of those over there say word problem.,agent
47,28:19:00,"There are already so many modules over here, at least eight of them, OK?",agent
47,28:25:00,And they are pretty longer modules.,agent
47,28:27:00,"So what we have done is that in order order to make sure that you don't spend time doing everything in the course and only work on that requires your attention, we have put diagnostic quizzes right at the beginning of every single module.",agent
47,28:44:00,So there is a concept diagnostic and there is AG Map skill diagnostic.,agent
47,28:49:00,"Go ahead, give that diagnostic and let the system decide what needs your attention and what does not need your attention.",agent
47,28:58:00,So only focus on what requires your focus.,agent
47,29:02:00,You don't have to do things that you're already good at.,agent
47,29:05:00,So this will customize your or personalize your one force more for you so that you can move faster.,agent
47,29:11:00,So this is how you will move through the entire one course.,agent
47,29:16:00,"One basic first, then number properties Stage 1, stage two, word problem Stage 1, Stage 2, advanced topic Stage 1 and Stage 2, and Algebra Stage 1 and stage 2 Stage 2.",agent
47,29:28:00,"So by the time you finish everything over here in stage 2, you would have actually solved some 240 to 260 questions through these cementing quizzes, hard and medium and single section questions.",agent
47,29:47:00,"So so yeah, I, I'm on this understanding that it's better for me to focus on one section first, finish it, study all that it has in verbal, then I finish that then then I go to quant and I think in the future when I'm almost taking the test, I will just take questions and see where are my gaps.",prospect
47,30:06:00,"So this is the suggestion here, right?",prospect
47,30:09:00,Yeah.,agent
47,30:09:00,OK.,agent
47,30:10:00,That's that's what we always believe.,agent
47,30:12:00,"And each EG Matt, that you, because DI, I mean verbal and quant, they have two very different skill sets.",agent
47,30:20:00,Yeah.,prospect
47,30:21:00,"And if you're think about it, if you're only giving two hours every single day to study and if you say, OK, one hour, I'll do this, one hour I'll I will do that.",agent
47,30:31:00,"Your mind will like take time, yeah, to switch gears from 1:00 to another and you won't be able to learn anything in one go.",agent
47,30:39:00,"So we are focusing on let's just get this done once and for all, then we keep it aside.",agent
47,30:45:00,"It's like learning your taking your piano lessons all in, you know, 30 days.",agent
47,30:50:00,"So that when you're focusing totally on that, you develop that muscle memory so that even if you don't get to play for too long, once you sit and touch that key, those keys, you know how to play, it becomes that intuitional for you, right?",agent
47,31:05:00,So this is what we are doing.,agent
47,31:07:00,"However, because you would be spending almost 5 weeks or almost six weeks on your quant, every single week, we will administer a verbal mock for you so that you still keep in touch with everything that you have learned in verbal.",agent
47,31:24:00,So you will not go out of practice when you are doing verbal.,agent
47,31:27:00,"In the same way, when you come to DI, we will now give you a verbal mock also and we will give you a quant mock also.",agent
47,31:34:00,"So say Saturday you will do verbal, Sunday you will do quant and you will prepare for for your DI as well.",agent
47,31:39:00,"Again, keeping you in touch with everything that you have learned.",agent
47,31:43:00,Makes sense.,prospect
47,31:43:00,"OK, Yeah, makes nice.",prospect
47,31:45:00,"OK, so with this now this is this is when when you finish your quant preparation again, sexual mocks, we will give you 45 minutes, 21 questions.",agent
47,31:58:00,"Let's see how much we have improved and whatever little round UPS needed to be there, it would be done at this stage only.",agent
47,32:05:00,"Once this is done again, we will go back to our course.",agent
47,32:09:00,"Data insights, same thing, data sufficiency.",agent
47,32:12:00,Stage 1.,agent
47,32:13:00,Stage 2.,agent
47,32:14:00,"Gita Stage 1, Stage 2, TPA, MSR both individually.",agent
47,32:18:00,Stage 1.,agent
47,32:19:00,Stage 2.,agent
47,32:20:00,"So when you finish your stage 2 from DI again, the same number of questions you would have solved over here, 240 to 250 months.",agent
47,32:29:00,"OK, so everything would be done over here.",agent
47,32:32:00,"Once again we will give you sectional mark just for DI, just to check how much you have learned, what else is required.",agent
47,32:39:00,"Once all of that is done, that's when towards the last leg of your preparation, just the last week, we will start giving you one walk after the other.",agent
47,32:49:00,"You can decide OK, this combination of order is working for me.",agent
47,32:53:00,"Two hours is sitting for exam getting too much on me, Am I OK with everything, when to take my break, when to do thing, what time of the day shall I go and get my exams that I'm at my optimum to write everything down and so on so forth.",agent
47,33:06:00,So all those things we will decide over this period of time and I'm showing you a score of somebody who's very similar with you in your skills.,agent
47,33:18:00,", you told me, hey, shut that, you know, I I would be somewhere around 55545.",agent
47,33:23:00,This girl was also at 555 when she started her course.,agent
47,33:26:00,She was aiming at 695.,agent
47,33:29:00,"Within two months, she was able to achieve 695.",agent
47,33:32:00,This is her real score on GMAP as well.,agent
47,33:36:00,So she did get 140 point improvement.,agent
47,33:39:00,I will share her success story with you.,agent
47,33:41:00,"So that Leela, that's her name if I show you the course.",agent
47,33:45:00,Hello Leela.,agent
47,33:46:00,"That's what it says, right?",agent
47,33:47:00,So I'm gonna share her success story with you.,agent
47,33:50:00,"And so yeah, she actually made that 140 point progress in two months time.",agent
47,33:55:00,You are giving us four to five months.,agent
47,33:57:00,"Absolutely doable , even with a full time job that you are doing.",agent
47,34:02:00,"OK, nice.",prospect
47,34:03:00,I'm pretty much done showing everything that I had to show here.,agent
47,34:08:00,Now I'm ready to answer any questions that you may have from me.,agent
47,34:13:00,"No, I think my questions you, you already answered during during that time.",prospect
47,34:18:00,So I think I'm comfortable.,prospect
47,34:20:00,"I just want to understand now that we've made a plan, where do I see it?",prospect
47,34:24:00,How do how do I see it?,prospect
47,34:25:00,Where do I look?,prospect
47,34:27:00,And I just want to get started.,prospect
47,34:29:00,OK.,agent
47,34:29:00,"If you wanna get started, , what I will do is that I can share the link of this study plan with you right away on the WhatsApp.",agent
47,34:40:00,But make sure that you access this planner only when you're logged into your account.,agent
47,34:47:00,OK.,prospect
47,34:47:00,Wow.,prospect
47,34:47:00,OK.,prospect
47,34:48:00,Yeah.,agent
47,34:48:00,OK.,agent
47,34:48:00,That's when it's going to work.,agent
47,34:50:00,Otherwise it will not because you know you have not purchased the course and it is not made in your paid account.,agent
47,34:57:00,So here you are.,agent
47,35:02:00,I have shared the PSP with you already.,agent
47,35:05:00,"Now if I'm looking at the PSP, let me share my screen so that you know what I'm talking about here.",agent
47,35:14:00,OK.,agent
47,35:14:00,"So 545 to 685, it's taking us about four months, OK, June, July, sorry, Feb, March, April and May.",agent
47,35:27:00,So it's exactly taking us four months.,agent
47,35:30:00,"So I would say, , that you can buy a four month course from EG MAT to keep your subscription on for all those days.",agent
47,35:40:00,And then you can always go for a one week extension or whatever it is.,agent
47,35:45:00,You know that we can work out later if we want to keep that subscription on till 28th of May that we'll figure out how to do.,agent
47,35:53:00,"But yeah, I would suggest that a four month plan is what will work for you at this point in time if you were to buy this program, this is this will cost you 299, OK, 99 US pharma plan, 299 USD.",agent
47,36:13:00,"OK, nice.",prospect
47,36:15:00,Yes.,prospect
47,36:16:00,And I've already shared your a planner with you.,agent
47,36:19:00,"If you plan to take your as you were telling me over the text that, hey, you know, I'll look into some of the sections.",agent
47,36:26:00,"And then over the weekend, I want to do my mock test as well.",agent
47,36:30:00,"So once you write your mock test, just leave me a message that, hey, shut, I've done my mock test.",agent
47,36:35:00,Then what I will do is that I will create your planner on your real scores.,agent
47,36:41:00,"OK, nice.",prospect
47,36:42:00,Yeah.,agent
47,36:42:00,"And then you will have the real scores with your real target, everything because here I've just put in some, you know, imaginary numbers for you given that.",agent
47,36:52:00,"OK, this is you're, you're good in verbal, not so good in quantum, kinda OK ish in data itself.",agent
47,36:57:00,"But once you give me the mock test, mock test scores, then I will create the real planner for you and then I'll share share it with you.",agent
47,37:04:00,"But right now you can keep it for reference to just see that, OK, this is how every day will go and this is how what I'm going to put my course makes sense.",agent
47,37:13:00,Perfect.,prospect
47,37:14:00,"All righty , any other questions that you may have?",agent
47,37:18:00,Just a question.,prospect
47,37:19:00,I'm coming from Brazil.,prospect
47,37:20:00,Do you think that the 685 is a good is a good score for me to a because I know that there's a little bit different is if the person from USA from Europe.,prospect
47,37:29:00,I think it it has a variety.,prospect
47,37:32:00,"I think the 685 is OK, right.",prospect
47,37:35:00,"Yes, 685 is absolutely a perfect score for you don't because a lot of Indians also give GMAP Yeah.",agent
47,37:42:00,"So we tell them also that, you know, at least aim for 685.",agent
47,37:46:00,I would never encourage you to go anything be below this.,agent
47,37:50:00,"Let's at least aim for 685 and then let's work towards it and let's see where, where, where do we go.",agent
47,37:56:00,But at least 86685 is a good score.,agent
47,37:59:00,It's a very comfortable score.,agent
47,38:00:00,"I mean, if if I get 6685, I'm gonna go and sleep.",prospect
47,38:04:00,I'm not gonna worry too much about.,prospect
47,38:06:00,It's OK.,prospect
47,38:07:00,"Yeah, it's OK.",agent
47,38:07:00,Absolutely.,agent
47,38:09:00,OK.,agent
47,38:09:00,All right.,agent
47,38:11:00,OK.,prospect
47,38:11:00,So really clear.,prospect
47,38:13:00,Thank you for your time and for explaining me all of that.,prospect
47,38:16:00,I think I'll.,prospect
47,38:18:00,It will help me a lot.,prospect
47,38:19:00,My preparation time.,prospect
47,38:21:00,Sure.,agent
47,38:21:00,Thank you.,agent
47,38:22:00,"Thank you, .",agent
47,38:22:00,"Whatever you decide, just let me know you have my phone number.",agent
47,38:26:00,"Whenever you're done with my mock, just let me know and then we can.",agent
47,38:31:00,OK?,agent
47,38:32:00,Thank you.,prospect
47,38:33:00,All righty.,agent
47,38:34:00,Have a great rest of your day.,agent
47,38:35:00,Bye for now.,agent
47,38:36:00,For you too.,prospect
47,38:36:00,Bye.,prospect
47,38:37:00,Bye.,agent
63,00:02,"In organization for 4 1/2 years now and before that I did, we did.",prospect
63,00:08,"And for GMAT prep, I've been like, I'm practicing online some of the quantitative questions, critical reasoning.",prospect
63,00:17,Yeah.,prospect
63,00:18,OK.,agent
63,00:19,"So when you say practicing online, what are your resources right now?",agent
63,00:22,I'm work.,prospect
63,00:24,I'm practicing from gmatclub.com.,prospect
63,00:26,"OK, got it.",agent
63,00:28,And we are a few more resources here and there.,prospect
63,00:31,Got it.,agent
63,00:32,"But GMAT club is your main resource as of now, correct?",agent
63,00:36,Got it.,agent
63,00:37,And how long have you been preparing so far?,agent
63,00:41,"Couple of months, couple of months.",prospect
63,00:43,OK.,agent
63,00:44,Have you taken any full length mock test?,agent
63,00:46,"Not yet, but I'm planning to do it in coming week, correct, Yes, because you've been preparing for a couple of months.",prospect
63,00:53,"Very important to get a baseline of where you stand right now, correct?",agent
63,00:57,So that will allow us to know what are your strengths and areas of improvement and what are the areas we need to target.,agent
63,01:03,"So that is there, what's the plan?",agent
63,01:05,"When are you looking to give the exam this March or April, March or April?",prospect
63,01:12,"So, so you're looking to apply in round one this year, correct?",agent
63,01:15,Correct.,prospect
63,01:16,Got it.,prospect
63,01:16,"And which business schools are you aiming at Pounds, Cambridge Offshore and AUM.",prospect
63,01:27,Got it.,agent
63,01:28,Makes sense.,agent
63,01:29,Perfect.,agent
63,01:30,So March or April.,agent
63,01:31,So that gives us basically around two to three months in your prep right now.,agent
63,01:36,"Further correct, Correct.",prospect
63,01:38,Got it.,agent
63,01:38,And how many hours are you planning on devoting every day in your prep?,agent
63,01:43,"I'm like, I'm working right now.",prospect
63,01:45,"So weekends I do give 4:00 to 5:00 hours, but on weekdays it's always not possible.",prospect
63,01:54,"But I try to give one 1-2 hours, one to two hours.",prospect
63,01:59,Got it.,agent
63,02:00,"OK, makes sense.",agent
63,02:01,So right.,agent
63,02:02,So this is there.,agent
63,02:04,How did you find us?,agent
63,02:05,How did you come across EG Mat?,agent
63,02:08,"When I was looking with the resources, I came across EG Mat also.",prospect
63,02:12,But at the time everything is paid.,prospect
63,02:14,So I shifted to G Mat club.,prospect
63,02:16,There are some few practice questions and then one of my like mother's friend's child is also like in this.,prospect
63,02:25,They have I qualified and they are right now studying in Cambridge.,prospect
63,02:29,So they also referred me EG mad got it.,prospect
63,02:33,"OK, makes sense.",agent
63,02:35,So what are the questions you have for me about your private about the platform?,agent
63,02:39,"First thing is like, should I go for GMAT Full example GMAT Focus?",prospect
63,02:45,"OK, because I got to know that GMAT Focus is a better route.",prospect
63,02:50,So I was preparing for GMAT Focus.,prospect
63,02:51,Only for now GMAT the Classic is no longer an option.,agent
63,02:55,And actually it has no longer been been an option since 31st January 2024.,agent
63,03:01,It it has completely been replaced by GMAT Focus Edition.,agent
63,03:04,So almost for an entire year now it's only GMAT Focus Edition.,agent
63,03:08,"OK, So I guess I'm on right track then in GMAT Focus.",prospect
63,03:13,"So there is range, right?",prospect
63,03:15,"So the colleges I'm trying to target what, what par score I do need, correct.",prospect
63,03:22,"Like below that, there is no chance.",prospect
63,03:25,That is what I'm concerned.,prospect
63,03:27,"Got it, got it.",agent
63,03:28,"So typically the Business School that you mentioned, the median score is going to be close to six, 75685.",agent
63,03:33,Typically that's a median score.,agent
63,03:35,Always a good idea to aim at least 2030 points higher.,agent
63,03:38,"So the score that you've targeted, 705 is basically a good score to aim at these business schools.",agent
63,03:44,"In fact, I would say make it, make your target to be something close to 7:15.",agent
63,03:48,That's a 99 percentile.,agent
63,03:50,"Now, of course, that's a decent score to be aiming at the Business School that you mentioned.",agent
63,03:55,"Apart from that, other factors of your profile like your business, sorry, your work experience, your leadership experience, extracurriculars, academics, all of those matter as well.",agent
63,04:06,"So when you decide on the right GMAT score, you need to decide on the fact that what do you want that GMAT score to do for you.",agent
63,04:14,"For example, if you have a strong profile, you can arrange strong letters of recommendation, then you're safe enough targeting even the median score, something like a 685.",agent
63,04:22,"If there are parts of your profile which you feel need to be offset with other with a good GMAT score, then you need to be aiming 2030 points higher around that.",agent
63,04:31,"I, I'm like letter of recommendation would be from the organization, right?",prospect
63,04:35,"Not from the college which it's 4.5 years since I left college, right?",prospect
63,04:41,Typically again from your immediate supervisor.,agent
63,04:43,That would be the ideal thing.,agent
63,04:45,The immediate supervisor I can arrange a good letter of recommendation and how many letter of recommendations are required.,prospect
63,04:53,"Again, that that is something we need to look at every business school's requirements.",agent
63,04:58,"So that may vary from one Business School to Business School in, in in terms of other parts of your profile.",agent
63,05:04,"If if you need help with profile evaluation, better thing it would be to get in touch with a good admissions consultant so that they can, because we're at the prep side of things, so they can verify your evaluate your profile and then recommend which courses, which programs would suit your profile.",agent
63,05:20,I did that.,prospect
63,05:20,"I did recommend to, I'm, I mean, I did consult two or three bill consultants and what I, what I finalize things on that first I need a GMAT score and then I need to, and like almost all of them told me that you have a decent profile, but the first thing is you need to get this GMAT score out of the way.",prospect
63,05:45,"So they, they didn't like force me on any particular score, but but yeah, they, they told me that first get the GMAT out of the way.",prospect
63,05:55,Then we can plan the applications to which school and everything.,prospect
63,06:00,"But yeah, they do did tell me that that the profile is a decent profile because I do have exposure also.",prospect
63,06:07,"And back in the college days, I used to do some event organizations as well.",prospect
63,06:11,I was part of extracurricular activities as well.,prospect
63,06:14,"So yeah, yeah.",prospect
63,06:15,And academic wise is also decent enough.,prospect
63,06:19,Got it.,agent
63,06:20,So yeah.,agent
63,06:20,So you have that cover?,agent
63,06:21,Exactly.,agent
63,06:22,"I mean, that's typically what was admission consultancy anyway, because Dmart is your first step.",agent
63,06:26,"Once you have that score out of the way, then the rest of the process starts making sense that you can peacefully devote good two to three months to work on your application.",agent
63,06:33,"And you know, you should you join an Envision consultant, you also want to give them sufficient time as well to work with you on your application essays and all.",agent
63,06:40,So that is there.,agent
63,06:42,And plus the good ones are booked by me.,prospect
63,06:44,"So the timeline that you have, March and April is actually required for you because then the consultants that remain after me, they're generally not that good.",prospect
63,06:53,"So, so, so March, April timeline is pretty important for round one.",agent
63,06:58,So do do you recommend any of the consultants?,prospect
63,07:00,"Like do I, I'll give you website links after our call.",agent
63,07:04,I'll share the website links of the recommended division consultants.,agent
63,07:06,"You can contact them, try and have an initial conversation if needed, but I'll I'll share those links with you.",agent
63,07:13,OK.,prospect
63,07:14,"And one more thing like do you give a mock test before joining so that I can evaluate like do I need to hello, your voice sort of broke off you're back now.",prospect
63,07:23,"Yeah, please go ahead.",agent
63,07:25,"Yeah, I was asking that do you provide a mock test?",prospect
63,07:29,"So before joining and before like actually moving into the finances thing, I do get to know like where I stand so that do I need self practice still more or can I go with the exam?",prospect
63,07:41,"Because anyways, like I discussed with you, I'll be able to take only one or two months program, not more than that.",prospect
63,07:48,It's quite expensive as well.,prospect
63,07:50,"So like I want to go in with like half, more than half prepared and like only defining things and to target the score and I want to achieve.",prospect
63,08:03,Got it.,agent
63,08:04,So we do have a free mock test.,agent
63,08:05,We have a free trial course.,agent
63,08:06,Have you joined that free trial course?,agent
63,08:09,"No, not yet.",prospect
63,08:09,My EG matter.,prospect
63,08:11,I haven't tried anything.,prospect
63,08:12,I just contacted just now like in two weeks back.,prospect
63,08:15,Got it.,agent
63,08:16,So there's a free trial course.,agent
63,08:18,I they share the direct link to the free trial course.,agent
63,08:20,It has 25 free video lessons across verbal content DA.,agent
63,08:25,Typically these are interactive video lessons.,agent
63,08:26,A file takes about 30 minutes of your time.,agent
63,08:28,"After every concept, there's a short course that gives you an understanding of how well you've learned the concept.",agent
63,08:33,So you have those as part of your free trial.,agent
63,08:36,Free trial is like 5% of the full course.,agent
63,08:38,"You have one free full length adaptive mock test called the Sigma X mock which will give you complete analysis just like the official D Sorry, sorry, sorry to cut you off.",agent
63,08:47,Your voice broke.,prospect
63,08:49,Got it.,agent
63,08:49,So what I was saying was free trial has 25 plus free video lessons and apart from that you have one free mock test available.,agent
63,08:57,It's a full length adaptive test called the Sigma X mock.,agent
63,08:59,It will give you the analysis just like the official GMAT.,agent
63,09:03,"OK, So you can take that as part of your free trial course.",agent
63,09:07,"So in fact, let me show you how that mock would look like, how the interface would look like.",agent
63,09:13,"One SEC, sure.",prospect
63,09:15,"And one more request, can I also get the recording of the session?",prospect
63,09:20,"I will do that, of course, certainly.",agent
63,09:23,Sure.,agent
63,09:23,Let me share my screen.,agent
63,09:43,Yes.,agent
63,09:43,Can you see my screen?,agent
63,09:45,"Yeah, perfect.",prospect
63,09:46,Now this is what your first mock test will look like.,agent
63,09:50,"I mean, of course, overall has five full length tests.",agent
63,09:52,First one is available in your free trial course.,agent
63,09:54,"It will take 2.5 hours of your time, so you need to reserve the time, you know, and take it when you're at your best.",agent
63,09:59,"You're not exhausted after the end of a, you know, long day's work because we wanted to be a good indicator of your ability.",agent
63,10:07,"Now, once you take this mock, you'll get a clear breakdown.",agent
63,10:09,"What is your verbal ability, Converb ability, DI ability, and you will also get the further breakdown.",agent
63,10:15,"So for example, within verbal, where, where are you stronger?",agent
63,10:19,Do are you strong in critical reasoning or are you stronger reading compression?,agent
63,10:22,"You get this, these data points and you'll get the complete question wise attempt.",agent
63,10:27,"You have this time management chart where you can see for different question, what is the time you took?",agent
63,10:32,What is the median time?,agent
63,10:33,What was the difficulty level of the questions?,agent
63,10:35,You can see the topics you got right or wrong with timing info as well as detailed solutions to each and every question that you attempt here.,agent
63,10:41,"So essentially 2.5 hours, you'll get a complete picture of where you spend, where you stand right now.",agent
63,10:48,"OK, So the first level, yeah, go ahead.",agent
63,10:51,"In GMAT there is only these three sections, right?",prospect
63,10:54,"Critical reasoning in relation then quantitative, right, Verbal, quant and data insights, Yes, yeah, verbal, quant and data.",agent
63,11:02,"So data insights, is that critical reasoning part only, right?",prospect
63,11:05,"No, no, no, no, no.",agent
63,11:06,Verbal has two subsections.,agent
63,11:09,"In fact, let me share the whiteboard.",agent
63,11:12,We will discuss by actually by critical reasoning.,prospect
63,11:14,"What I'm trying to refer is that 2 statements are given and according to those statements, you can decide that if first statement is enough to answer second statement, data sufficiency, which is a part of data insights.",prospect
63,11:28,Data insights.,agent
63,11:29,"OK, yeah, yeah, that's what I was referring.",prospect
63,11:31,So that is under data sufficient.,prospect
63,11:34,So data insights is more than data sufficiency.,agent
63,11:38,"Yeah, yeah, of course.",prospect
63,11:40,Explain that only you you're able to see the whiteboard.,agent
63,11:43,"Yeah, yeah, correct.",prospect
63,11:44,"So 3 sections, verbal, content, data, insights.",agent
63,11:47,"Verbal has 2 broad subsections, critical reasoning and reading comprehension.",agent
63,11:51,"Critical reasoning is where you're given a paragraph, you basically identify strengtheners, you evaluate the argument, you look at assumptions behind that argument.",agent
63,11:59,So which is basically making sense out of a paragraph.,agent
63,12:02,"Reading comprehension is unseen passage, making sense out of a passage.",agent
63,12:05,"Then you have quant, it has 2 broad areas, arithmetic and algebra.",agent
63,12:11,"Arithmetic further has three areas number properties, even odd prime numbers, word problems, distance, speed, work rate and so on and advanced topics probability, permutation combination.",agent
63,12:23,These topics data insights is four data sufficiency which is what we were talking about multi source easing two-part analysis and the fourth one is graphs and tables or in other words graphics interpretation and table analysis.,agent
63,12:42,This is the broad overview of the exam.,agent
63,12:45,"And do you provide like part exams also mock exams like I I, I am yeah sectional mocks because I get what verbal and quantitative is but for DI and I have practice mostly data sufficiency till now.",prospect
63,13:01,So I just want to see like what type of questions is other 3 sections out correct?,prospect
63,13:06,"So in the full course, we have 50 plus sectional mocks with individually you'll have 15 sectional mocks in verbal, 15 plus in quant and 15 plus in DI.",agent
63,13:17,"In the free trial course, you get one, one free sectional mock for each of these areas, verbal content, data, insights.",agent
63,13:23,"OK, one, one is there, right?",prospect
63,13:25,Absolutely.,agent
63,13:26,Sure.,prospect
63,13:26,"And in that they will also when when once submitted, they will also specify that this question was of which out of these four which path?",prospect
63,13:34,"Yeah, absolutely.",agent
63,13:36,Yeah.,prospect
63,13:36,OK.,prospect
63,13:37,And one more question.,prospect
63,13:37,"So in quant you are telling that arithmetic and algebra, so there is no geometric lines.",prospect
63,13:43,"And yes, there is no geometry.",agent
63,13:46,"No, there's no geometry, no geometric.",prospect
63,13:48,"A couple of concepts are there in coordinate geometry, but that will cover as part of algebra only, but no geometry otherwise.",agent
63,13:55,"So the like back in the day in 10th in not in 10th, I think in 12th we used to do the lines and planes that is there or not No, OK, just couple of concepts in coordinate geometry that is it OK, sure, sure.",prospect
63,14:13,Right.,agent
63,14:14,"Any other questions, doubts and then no, I think I'm good with this, but I'll need at least this week so that on.",prospect
63,14:26,"I'm planning since you said no that we don't, I don't need to give an exam at the exhausted state.",prospect
63,14:31,"So I'm having that on probably Saturday morning I'll give full exam and then maybe Sunday morning, maybe Saturday sectional exams and Sunday morning I'll give the complete exam.",prospect
63,14:44,So after that I can flex every start I can plan to take the course.,prospect
63,14:49,So what do you suggest?,agent
63,14:50,"What will be the better like according to what you have got from my insights, Like what will be better one month or because I'm thinking one month will be a little crammed up time and maybe I feel like.",prospect
63,15:04,And one more question.,agent
63,15:05,"So if I feel at any time that I need extension to this, So what is the way to wait for that and what are the finances for that?",prospect
63,15:13,Correct.,agent
63,15:14,Extensions are priced at $89.00 a month standard.,agent
63,15:16,"Whichever course you go for, be it one month, be it 2 month, there's a standard extension price of $89.00 a month.",agent
63,15:21,"So we'll at any point in time if you feel the need to extend the course, you'll have that option $89.00 a month.",agent
63,15:29,OK.,prospect
63,15:30,"And if I go for like 2 months, you were giving 112 months, $159, right, 159 as part of the promotion that we were running at that point in time.",prospect
63,15:43,"It's not live right now, but I can take an approval and help you out with that.",agent
63,15:47,"Like two months at 159, yes, OK.",prospect
63,15:53,So do you think like two months will be sufficient for my preparation like the place I am in and the what I have I shared with you like what I have done till now?,prospect
63,16:06,"So will two months will be sufficient or I need more than that, Correct.",prospect
63,16:10,So first thing is we don't know what your baseline score is right now.,agent
63,16:14,"So at this point in time, both of us, we don't know whether you're at A500 or A600 or a 555, we don't know that.",agent
63,16:21,So once we have this.,agent
63,16:22,"So what we'll do is once you've taken the mock test, we'll do this session again.",agent
63,16:28,"I'll create a study plan for you, which will basically give you an understanding of what your strengths and weaknesses are, how much time you're looking at overall, what are the steps involved?",agent
63,16:36,Do you need to cover foundations in any area or can we directly move to sectional mocks or taking full length mocks?,agent
63,16:41,"So we'll do this call again, then we'll create your study band and then it will give us a clearer picture of what your timeline should be.",agent
63,16:49,Should you be looking at one month of prep?,agent
63,16:50,Should you be looking at 2 month of prep or maybe more?,agent
63,16:53,"But mock will answer that question for us actually, correct, correct.",agent
63,16:56,Actually my only concern this part is like I don't want my like I'm taking the course also and my like my money is getting wasted and I'm not able to achieve that.,prospect
63,17:09,"So that's why I want to be totally sure before getting the course and everything, because see, the GMAT and everything is, we all know that it is an expensive affair.",prospect
63,17:19,It is correct.,agent
63,17:20,"After that, the exam will be there and going abroad.",prospect
63,17:23,"So I'm, I'm trying to manage my finances so that I don't waste anything before even getting started.",prospect
63,17:30,Got it.,agent
63,17:31,"No, no, I appreciate the fact that you're careful with your finances.",agent
63,17:34,"So again, that, that, that is the reason why that second call would be needed so that we have a clear time.",agent
63,17:39,"Now, let me show you an example of what a study plan looks like.",agent
63,17:43,"Sure, what's and during this whole journey, like there will be different tutors or who'll be supporting me or who'll be like contacting me, correct.",prospect
63,17:53,I I'll explain the support as well.,agent
63,17:55,"So firstly, we'll look at the study plan.",agent
63,17:57,Let me share my screen.,agent
63,18:05,Are you able to see my screen?,agent
63,18:09,Yeah.,agent
63,18:09,OK.,agent
63,18:10,"Now, first thing is now what I was saying was the study plan, yes.",agent
63,18:14,"So based on where you stand right now, the course has an AI driven study plan which we can create in our next section, our next session.",agent
63,18:21,"In that study plan, to create that high level plan, you'll need three things.",agent
63,18:25,"Your starting score, your target score and the time that you can devote every week with that study plan will give you based on your current instance and weaknesses, a clear personalized target for each area.",agent
63,18:36,So you'll have different goals even in critical reasoning and eating comprehension or the DI areas or quant areas as well.,agent
63,18:43,"And based on your time investment, it will also give you a clear cut timeline.",agent
63,18:47,"So for example, CR to go from 57 percentile to 95 percentile, you'll let's say take about 1.6 weeks of effort.",agent
63,18:53,So study plan will give you the timelines in that much depth.,agent
63,18:57,"And for an individual area like wobble, it will show you the your time investment as well.",agent
63,19:01,"Well overall, so this guy for example, to go from 48 percentile to 97 percentile will take about 90 hours of effort.",agent
63,19:07,You'll have that info.,agent
63,19:08,This is your total preparation time.,agent
63,19:10,"It will include time to work on any foundations if needed, practicing section marks, full length marks.",agent
63,19:16,All of that time is included and basis that you get a tentative exam date.,agent
63,19:21,"So right from the beginning, you can see what kind of timeline you are looking at.",agent
63,19:24,"Are you looking at one month, 2 month or maybe more?",agent
63,19:27,We can we can look create that plan and know for sure.,agent
63,19:30,Plus study plan will also give you the individual steps that you need to take on a particular area like critical reasoning or reading comprehension.,agent
63,19:38,"For example, 2 steps in critical reasoning, we need to cover foundations.",agent
63,19:43,We need to cement those foundations by doing a structured and targeted practice.,agent
63,19:46,"And for these steps, you'll get the hourly estimate as well how many hours you'll need for completing that step.",agent
63,19:52,"So will not only get this data step by step plan, it will also be in the right sequence.",agent
63,19:57,Should you do verbal for should you do quant?,agent
63,19:59,What should be the order?,agent
63,20:00,Verbal is recommended that you do it first because variety of concepts is lesser.,agent
63,20:04,DI should be covered last because verbal and con concepts are going to be helpful in learning.,agent
63,20:08,"DI will study, man will give you these and to track your progress continuously, you'll get this tracker.",agent
63,20:16,Exactly what you need to do on a given day is given to you.,agent
63,20:18,"Once you complete the task, you can mark it as completed.",agent
63,20:20,It will then be crossed off.,agent
63,20:22,You can adjust your hours.,agent
63,20:23,"For example, this day you committed to two hours, but you find your you took a leave let's say from work, maybe you can devote 4 hours so you can save it and close it accordingly.",agent
63,20:30,"Your time, not your study plan will align with it.",agent
63,20:33,So that's so even moving it from 2:00 to 4:00 hours.,agent
63,20:35,So will the task increase or something like it will be adjusted.,prospect
63,20:39,It will be adjusted basically you by design you will have one learning activity in a day.,agent
63,20:44,"But again, so let's say doing master combination course, the human effort is 7 hours since we are devoting 2 two hours every day.",agent
63,20:52,The 4th day it's we can devote 5 hours but overall effort is 7 hours.,agent
63,20:57,And by 22 to 24th we'll have six hours.,agent
63,21:01,"But by design, we are not starting a new learning activity on a particular day, which is exactly what's mentioned here.",agent
63,21:06,So you won't get multiple tasks in a day.,agent
63,21:07,"But again, let's say one hour on this day we complete the course.",agent
63,21:11,"You're not exhausted, not fatigue.",agent
63,21:12,"You can definitely start with the next step, that is anyway.",agent
63,21:15,Sure.,prospect
63,21:18,And one more thing.,prospect
63,21:18,"So suppose after giving the mock exam, I feel like I only need the test series.",prospect
63,21:25,I don't require the full course.,prospect
63,21:27,So is there that option as well as like 10 tests given to me?,prospect
63,21:32,"Unfortunately, no.",agent
63,21:33,"Like I mentioned in my e-mail, we don't have courses that cater to let's say just the mock test or just verbal, just **** just TI because, and there's a reason for it because a mock by itself is a diagnostic tool.",agent
63,21:48,It tells you what your current ability is at a particular point in time.,agent
63,21:52,"For example, let's say the student takes a mock and he gets a 665.",agent
63,21:58,Let's say he wants a 7:05.,agent
63,22:00,"Now the analysis, this is only diagnostic data.",agent
63,22:04,"This is only telling us where you're strong, where you need more help.",agent
63,22:07,"But let's say if this guy were to improve quant, we need to go deeper into what exactly his gaps are.",agent
63,22:13,Let's say arithmetic is a 77 percentile and we need to improve on this area.,agent
63,22:18,"Then your practice data becomes very, very crucial.",agent
63,22:21,How would you improve arithmetic?,agent
63,22:23,"Let's say within arithmetic, we just want to talk.",agent
63,22:25,We just want to see how to improve in number properties.,agent
63,22:29,Now your topic was data is very important.,agent
63,22:31,"We see that divisibility and is a strong topic, but estimation rounding is a weak topic.",agent
63,22:36,"Especially the timing issues are there, plus hard questions.",agent
63,22:38,Accuracy is not that great.,agent
63,22:40,"Now, if this is a problematic topic, you'll need access to the foundation course to fix this particular topic.",agent
63,22:48,"In this case, estimation and rounding, you'll need to revise the concept.",agent
63,22:53,You'll need to revise the approach.,agent
63,22:54,"So that is why an integrated courses, courses very much needed because mock only gives you your ability at a particular point in time.",agent
63,23:02,"So that's the reason why we don't offer different courses, I mean section specific or content specific courses.",agent
63,23:10,"But let's say if you're only interested in mock, let's say let's say you're not, you already had a good ability, you just want to work on your test readiness and you want 6 new mocks, then go for a short course.",agent
63,23:21,"No, then go for a one month course at $99.",agent
63,23:24,"Or let's say if or you want to let's say take mocks in 15 days, we can give you a 15 day course it at $49.00.",agent
63,23:31,"It will still have the entire content, but so basically I can shuffle my time according to what my abilities got it.",prospect
63,23:41,"And OK, this is one Part 1 extremity of the spectrum, but let's move to the other one.",prospect
63,23:46,So suppose I need like I did five.,prospect
63,23:50,"You're saying that we have 5 full mock tests, right?",prospect
63,23:53,Yes.,prospect
63,23:53,So now suppose like even after five I need some more mock test.,prospect
63,23:58,So what is the way to get that?,prospect
63,24:00:00,Like it is it will will it be provided as in the course or I need to take another course like what?,prospect
63,24:08:00,What will be that correct.,agent
63,24:09:00,So the course overall has five mocks.,agent
63,24:12:00,"So it's not that we hold back any mocks from a student and then you know for an additional course, give those mocks.",agent
63,24:18:00,No core course has five mocks.,agent
63,24:20:00,Now let's say you exhaust these mocks.,agent
63,24:21:00,First thing is you ideally should not be in a position where you have exhausted the Mogs and you still need further improvement.,agent
63,24:28:00,Why?,agent
63,24:29:00,"Because if a mock tells you that you are at a 665, you want to go to a 715.",agent
63,24:32:00,Better to do course correction before you take the next mock firstly.,agent
63,24:36:00,So ideally we should not be in a situation like this.,agent
63,24:39:00,"But let's say in the event that happens, first thing is you get 2 free mocks on mba.com.",agent
63,24:44:00,I I hope you're aware of that.,agent
63,24:46:00,You do.,prospect
63,24:47:00,You can retake those mocks as well.,agent
63,24:50:00,"In fact, in the first retake most of the questions are new SO2 free you get there.",agent
63,24:53:00,"Mocks 326 are available for a purchase on mba.com, that official website of GMAC, the console that runs the exam.",agent
63,25:00:00,So then you go for mocks 326.,agent
63,25:02:00,The retail price of those is close to 108 dollars.,agent
63,25:05:00,"If I if my memory serves right, EGMAR students can get those official mocks at a discount.",agent
63,25:10:00,"So in case you want to go for 326, you can write to the team, they'll tell you the available discount offer.",agent
63,25:15:00,Then you can get the three mocks 326 at a discount from mb.com.,agent
63,25:20:00,"OK, but ideally these fives are sufficient, correct?",prospect
63,25:25:00,"Ideally, these five are sufficient, correct?",agent
63,25:28:00,"Because only the first mock is what you'll take right now, the free trial one.",agent
63,25:32:00,The rest 4 you'll take towards the end of your journey.,agent
63,25:34:00,"Once verbal content DI, everything is sorted, foundations are done, you have practice, You've taken sectional mocks, Sure.",agent
63,25:41:00,"And now suppose like if I have some doubts in the like, I give them all, then I have sectional partner, then have doubts.",prospect
63,25:48:00,"So who'll be the support system, correct.",prospect
63,25:52:00,Like what is support?,prospect
63,25:54:00,So two kinds of support.,agent
63,25:55:00,One is subject matter support.,agent
63,25:57:00,Now let's pick any video lesson.,agent
63,25:59:00,"Let's say, let's pick this topic impact of only and all and inference in critical reasoning.",agent
63,26:05:00,"No, the doubt could be, let's say related to the concept or the solution of a question.",agent
63,26:08:00,"Right here, you'll have the doubt claim feature.",agent
63,26:10:00,Do you have a question?,agent
63,26:11:00,"Click on yes, you're taken to the forums.",agent
63,26:13:00,The forums is where you can post your query.,agent
63,26:16:00,Our subject matter experts respond to that query within a business day and the discussion log is maintained.,agent
63,26:22:00,So 90% of the times you'll see somebody has already asked the concern that you have.,agent
63,26:25:00,You can see the response and clarify your doubts on the spot.,agent
63,26:28:00,"Don't have to ask anything, don't have to post anything.",agent
63,26:31:00,"Like majority of the time to go 30,000 plus queries are already addressed.",agent
63,26:35:00,Individual more question solution will also have this same ask and expert feature.,agent
63,26:38:00,Individual question bank solution questions will also have the same ask and expert feature.,agent
63,26:43:00,This is what your subject matter help.,agent
63,26:45:00,"Now we also have strategy support, or in other words, dedicated mentor support.",agent
63,26:50:00,"You'll be assigned a dedicated mentor, a strategy expert that individual guides you throughout your journey every step of the way.",agent
63,26:57:00,"So wherever you need feedback on your course progress or you need help with your prep strategy, or let's say CR, your accuracy is not improving at the medium level.",agent
63,27:06:00,You reach out to your mentor.,agent
63,27:08:00,"Your mentor will analyze your course data at the back end, then they'll come back with the advice.",agent
63,27:12:00,All you need to do to access that support is just drop an e-mail within a business day.,agent
63,27:15:00,"Your mentor will analyze your course data, then they'll come back with the advice what you should be revising what kind of courses you need to be taking so you can leverage that supports route you preference.",agent
63,27:25:00,Sure.,prospect
63,27:25:00,And that mentor will be like in contact with me on e-mail only or what's up?,prospect
63,27:31:00,"Also emails, emails because The thing is emails allow us to keep everything on record.",agent
63,27:36:00,You or your mentor can refer to a past communication at a later point if needed.,agent
63,27:40:00,"One second thing is, let's say if your mentor is unavailable on a particular day, he or she is on a leave, then another mentor would jump in.",agent
63,27:46:00,"They'll look at the e-mail communication, they'll analyze your code data.",agent
63,27:48:00,They'll pick up exactly where the previous person left off.,agent
63,27:51:00,So this way your continuity will also not be Hanford.,agent
63,27:53:00,So that's why we use e-mail as that medium.,agent
63,27:56:00,"But if OK, I got it, that is one way.",prospect
63,27:58:00,But if I want like to be in touch on WhatsApp also.,prospect
63,28:03:00,So is that a possibility or not?,prospect
63,28:05:00,"No, no, no.",agent
63,28:06:00,"Again, same reason we keep e-mail as the mode of communication.",agent
63,28:11:00,"OK, OK, sure, sure.",prospect
63,28:14:00,"I think I'm good, but first I need to see where I stand and then I'll decide.",prospect
63,28:19:00,Got it.,agent
63,28:20:00,Makes sense.,agent
63,28:21:00,So when are you planning on taking the mock test?,agent
63,28:24:00,"This weekend, This weekend?",prospect
63,28:27:00,"So meanwhile, do explore the free trial codes.",agent
63,28:29:00,What I'll do today after call is I'll write a detailed e-mail to help you get started.,agent
63,28:33:00,It will have the mock link and the free trialing and some other useful links of the course.,agent
63,28:38:00,So you can explore the free trial.,agent
63,28:39:00,You can even watch the videos in your mobile phone.,agent
63,28:41:00,You can just log into the browser and access those video lessons in case you have any questions while going through the feature course.,agent
63,28:48:00,You have my WhatsApp number.,agent
63,28:48:00,Just feel free to reach out to me there.,agent
63,28:50:00,"And once you've taken the mock test, let me know we'll do a quick 1520 minute call.",agent
63,28:54:00,I'll create a steady plan for you and we'll address all your doubts and you'll look at the timeline as well.,agent
63,28:58:00,How long do you need?,agent
63,29:00:00,You know how what kind of preparation you need right now.,agent
63,29:03:00,"Sure, sure right.",prospect
63,29:05:00,Please share this video as well.,prospect
63,29:07:00,I'll do that.,agent
63,29:08:00,"I'll, I'll do it by EOD today because it will get up uploaded, but I'll share the recording right over our WhatsApp chat.",agent
63,29:15:00,"Sure, sure.",prospect
63,29:15:00,Thank you.,prospect
63,29:16:00,Most welcome.,agent
63,29:17:00,Really nice interacting with you and I wish you good luck for the mock test.,agent
63,29:19:00,Take care.,agent
63,29:20:00,Bye.,prospect
63,29:20:00,Thank you.,prospect
63,29:21:00,Thank you so much.,prospect
63,29:22:00,Nice having interactive session with you.,prospect
63,29:24:00,Thank you.,agent
63,29:25:00,Bye.,agent
71,00:02,What are you doing with respect to the Gmap preparation?,agent
71,00:04,Have you started it?,agent
71,00:05,Is this your first time?,agent
71,00:06,And what's the plan?,agent
71,00:07,If you can give me a little bit idea.,agent
71,00:10,It's my first time I've I've taken this decision very recently to write Gmap like maybe a one week or two weeks ago.,prospect
71,00:21,So got it.,agent
71,00:23,"So I have just gone through few walks, I mean not answered them just the PDF kind of things and just looked at them.",prospect
71,00:34,So just understand the pattern and everything.,prospect
71,00:36,Got it.,agent
71,00:37,That's it.,prospect
71,00:38,Got it.,agent
71,00:39,So what what is the main goal?,agent
71,00:42,Which B schools do you want to go to and when do you want to start your MBA program?,agent
71,00:47,What's the goal there?,agent
71,00:51,I want to go to ISB.,prospect
71,00:53,"OK, ISP.",agent
71,00:56,Got it.,agent
71,00:58,"The full time, the two year MBA, the the full time normal PGP program.",prospect
71,01:02,Is that the goal?,agent
71,01:04,Yeah.,prospect
71,01:05,PGPYLPGPYL.,prospect
71,01:08,So right now you're in your 4th year or what's the current status?,agent
71,01:14,I've been working.,prospect
71,01:15,It's been 10 months.,prospect
71,01:17,Got it.,agent
71,01:18,Maybe I should get ready in three months and then I should submit my application.,prospect
71,01:25,I think I should get more about ISP procedure and everything.,prospect
71,01:31,Understood.,agent
71,01:32,"So you're, you're saying you have the VILE deadline in April?",agent
71,01:34,Is that what it is?,agent
71,01:37,Application deadline?,agent
71,01:38,"Yeah, March or April, March or April and below.",prospect
71,01:44,"One year, work experience is below.",prospect
71,01:46,2 years of work experience is something they are eligible for.,agent
71,01:48,"VILE, right?",agent
71,01:49,Yeah.,prospect
71,01:50,"Yeah, two years.",prospect
71,01:51,We build less than two years.,agent
71,01:52,More than two years.,agent
71,01:53,It's the the normal PGP program.,agent
71,01:55,"OK, got it.",agent
71,01:57,Understood.,agent
71,01:57,So you'll have to wrap up the entire process in about 3 months or so.,agent
71,02:03,Got it.,agent
71,02:03,I just want to double check this one ISBYL application deadlines.,agent
71,02:11,That way we'll have a proper timeline.,agent
71,02:15,"Yeah, March 16th, that's the deadline.",agent
71,02:19,I'm sharing the screen.,agent
71,02:22,Yeah.,prospect
71,02:24,Can you see the screen?,agent
71,02:27,Yeah.,agent
71,02:27,"At LE Career Professional, zero to 24.",agent
71,02:29,"It's a 20 month program, application deadline March 16th, Round 2.",agent
71,02:35,"So by March 16th you'll have to take the GMAT, work on the application draft and completely do the submission as well.",agent
71,02:41,That's the last date.,agent
71,02:42,"So right now, forget January is over, you have February and made of one.",agent
71,02:48,1 1/2 month is there to do the entire thing currently as of now.,agent
71,02:52,"OK fine, got it.",prospect
71,02:54,Understood.,agent
71,02:54,"And for this 1 1/2 month on a daily basis, practically speaking, how much time can, you know, take out just for studying for the GMAT and this other stuff?",agent
71,03:06,Four to five hours because I have to go got it.,prospect
71,03:10,Four to five hours.,agent
71,03:11,Four to five hours is a lot of time for studying actually.,agent
71,03:13,So that is good.,agent
71,03:14,"If you can take four to five hours, good enough.",agent
71,03:17,"One 1 1/2 month timeline every day, four to five hours, I believe Saturday and Sunday you can put in more time that is possible.",agent
71,03:24,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
71,03:25,"Then, then, then time investment is will not be a constraint for you.",agent
71,03:30,You would have good amount.,agent
71,03:32,You don't have the luxury of time because we have to wrap it up in 1 1/2 month.,agent
71,03:35,But 45 hours is actually good amount of time to achieve anything in in about 45 days.,agent
71,03:40,So that that part is good.,agent
71,03:42,It's just that how do we utilize the time?,agent
71,03:44,"Are we studying in the right format, right structure that we're following or not?",agent
71,03:48,That's the deal.,agent
71,03:48,That's going to be the deal breaker.,agent
71,03:50,"In your case, that would happen.",agent
71,03:52,"OK, All right, so this part is there.",agent
71,03:54,Now I want to understand a couple of more things.,agent
71,03:56,"Do you have a GMAT score in mind right now, a target GMAT score in mind, 700 plus is what 700 plus is something that is required.",agent
71,04:08,7:05 or higher than that is something which you need.,agent
71,04:13,So how did you get to this target?,agent
71,04:18,How somebody told you or no?,agent
71,04:23,"When I'm going through this ISP admission process, they said that it's 700 plus.",prospect
71,04:28,"It will be good if you get 700 plus, correct, correct, correct.",prospect
71,04:33,So probably they are talking about the old GMAT 700 plus because that used to be an average score at ISB.,agent
71,04:43,Now we have a new GMAT.,agent
71,04:45,The calculation and all is different.,agent
71,04:47,On the old GMAT.,agent
71,04:48,A 700 score is equal to a 645 on the new GMAT.,agent
71,04:53,So that that that that hazard that is something which is there.,agent
71,04:56,"But regardless of that which for ISB, for YL program, because most early career candidates of play, they do threaten to submit a higher score because they are just fresh out of college.",agent
71,05:09,It's easy for them to prepare for the GMAT.,agent
71,05:12,So they do generally submit a higher score.,agent
71,05:14,"So in your case, 7:05 or higher is definitely should aim for it 99th percentile.",agent
71,05:21,"But even if you get a 670, 5685 score a little bit lower, it's fine.",agent
71,05:26,"675 or higher than that 96th percentile or higher than that, that would be a good target for ISP for the while program.",agent
71,05:33,So that part is there.,agent
71,05:35,"So yeah, you know, so 705 is your target if you get 20 points lower still OK, that that's what it it's going to be.",agent
71,05:42,"And right now you, you, I know you have looked at some old questions and tests, but how do you have full familiarity on the aspects of GMAT?",agent
71,05:55,"I mean, especially the questions.",agent
71,05:56,"Verbal is there within verbal, there are two types of things.",agent
71,05:59,"Critical reasoning, reading comprehension in quant arithmetic, algebra, in data insights, 4 type of questions are there that familiarity exists as of now or no?",agent
71,06:09,"Yeah, that exists.",prospect
71,06:11,"Critical, critical reasoning is separate or reading comprehension is separate.",prospect
71,06:14,"You're, you're familiar with that.",prospect
71,06:17,"OK, that is very good, that works.",agent
71,06:20,And so obviously you'll have to start the preparation right away.,agent
71,06:24,"Like tomorrow onwards, you'll have to start the preparation.",agent
71,06:27,There is no one day.,agent
71,06:30,"Two days is also a huge amount of time in, in your case, because the deadline is in about 1 1/2 month for sure we have to start right away.",agent
71,06:39,So you let me know exactly what do you want from this discussion.,agent
71,06:43,I'll try to focus on in that direction.,agent
71,06:45,What's the main goal?,agent
71,06:46,What do you want from this discussion?,agent
71,06:49,I just need the process to study.,prospect
71,06:51,"I mean, how will I get that score?",prospect
71,06:55,I need a process like I couldn't work on them.,prospect
71,06:59,"It's not too difficult and too easy, but you got it.",prospect
71,07:05,"How exactly to structure the overall preparation, what to follow, what to do, what not to do in a, in, in the in the next one week, what to do next, another one week, what to do that overall clarity unit.",agent
71,07:15,"Definitely, we'll discuss all those aspects in a proper structured way.",agent
71,07:18,We'll discuss that.,agent
71,07:20,Couple of more questions with respect to resources for studying for the GMAT.,agent
71,07:25,Do you already have a course or are you looking for the EGMAT course to study the next in the next 45 days?,agent
71,07:30,What is the plan there for the resources for the GMAT?,agent
71,07:36,I have some books.,prospect
71,07:38,I got them online.,prospect
71,07:40,"I mean, I just ordered them.",prospect
71,07:42,I'll tell you the book means yeah.,prospect
71,08:08,"This GMAT official guide that kind of I've got GMAT GMAT official Guide, normal book, right?",prospect
71,08:17,"the IT has all the three sections, verbal, quant and data insights.",prospect
71,08:21,"Yeah, yeah, got it.",agent
71,08:24,What else is there?,agent
71,08:28,That is the only book you have.,agent
71,08:29,"OK, understood, got it.",agent
71,08:31,So definitely you have to spend some time on that book.,agent
71,08:35,That is an official book.,agent
71,08:37,"It's the most authentic resource out there that you have to do, but you cannot do it right away.",agent
71,08:44,"So the official guide is nothing but a set of previous GMAT questions, the old GMAT questions, it has a bunch of things.",agent
71,08:52,Definitely you have to practice those questions.,agent
71,08:54,That way you would know that you are ready for the GMAT.,agent
71,08:57,"If you can solve those questions, obviously you can solve the GMAT kind of questions as well.",agent
71,09:02,That is number one.,agent
71,09:03,And of course there is a problem with that book.,agent
71,09:05,It has more of easy questions.,agent
71,09:06,It doesn't have a lot of hard level questions.,agent
71,09:09,That's how it is.,agent
71,09:10,That's that's what they do.,agent
71,09:11,"But yeah, unfortunately, but you have to do that.",agent
71,09:14,But that's not a book to learning learn stuff.,agent
71,09:19,"Let's say for example, critical reasoning is there.",agent
71,09:21,There are a bunch of concepts that you need to learn.,agent
71,09:23,You need to learn the right methodology to solve critical reasoning questions.,agent
71,09:27,"Similarly, algebra is there, bunch of concepts are there, and you need to have the right methodology to solve very hard level questions.",agent
71,09:33,A step by step method should be learned.,agent
71,09:35,All those things.,agent
71,09:36,You cannot do that from book.,agent
71,09:37,That book is mainly for practice.,agent
71,09:40,"So in your specific case, because you're a beginner to the preparation, your sequence of preparation will be like this.",agent
71,09:46,First you have to build a strong foundation #1 foundations and basics.,agent
71,09:50,"For on verbal quant, data insets, you'll have to fix.",agent
71,09:53,Then you have to learn the concepts that are tested on the GMAT.,agent
71,09:57,Then you have to learn the right method.,agent
71,09:59,"So you have foundation, you have conceptual and theoretical knowledge.",agent
71,10:03,"Now, when you see a critical reasoning question, what is the method to solve it?",agent
71,10:08,"When you see a algebra question, what is the method to solve it?",agent
71,10:11,You have to learn those methods and then you have to practice a lot using those methods.,agent
71,10:17,"In that practice stage, that book will come in place.",agent
71,10:21,"But before that, there are bunch of things that need to happen.",agent
71,10:24,"If we do not do these bunch of things, if we directly jump into practice, it will be a disaster.",agent
71,10:29,"So I mean that, that that's what it is.",agent
71,10:31,"I'm, I'm trying to be very transparent and little bit brutal as well, but that's what it is.",agent
71,10:36,So the book alone is not sufficient for sure.,agent
71,10:39,"And because you have to wrap up your Gmap preparation in 1 1/2 month, you have to go for a course.",agent
71,10:45,"For sure, EGMAD is the best course out there.",agent
71,10:48,"We have the we, we deliver the most number of success stories.",agent
71,10:51,"Definitely look, consider EGMAD, but do your research and choose any other course if you think that is the right fit for you.",agent
71,10:57,No problem at all.,agent
71,10:58,I'm not pushing EGMAD course here.,agent
71,11:00,You do your research and choose another course as well.,agent
71,11:02,But definitely you need a full-fledged course.,agent
71,11:05,"That book, you have to do that book, but somewhere in middle, not as the entire thing.",agent
71,11:10,So that is a big thing here.,agent
71,11:12,So what I will do right now is I'll take the next 15 minutes.,agent
71,11:17,"Let's discuss the exact strategy for the next 45 days, what needs to be done.",agent
71,11:23,We'll understand the overall philosophy of it.,agent
71,11:26,I will also share my screen.,agent
71,11:27,I'll show you the EG MAD course modules.,agent
71,11:29,"That way you understand if you're an EG MAD student, exactly how you can do the course.",agent
71,11:34,"So basically right now, let's assume that you're an EG MAD student.",agent
71,11:37,Let's see how you would prepare for the next 45 days.,agent
71,11:39,That way you'll have two things.,agent
71,11:41,One is you'll understand the entire philosophy of how to study for the 45 days.,agent
71,11:45,You will also see the AG Mat modules.,agent
71,11:47,"If you think the entire logic makes sense, you can obviously go with the AG Mat course so that that part is always there.",agent
71,11:52,We will do that.,agent
71,11:53,"And during this discussion, if you have any questions, stop me at any point and ask a question.",agent
71,11:58,"OK, OK, that that will do.",prospect
71,12:00,So I'm sharing the screen.,agent
71,12:02,Let me know if you can see it.,agent
71,12:04,Is this visible?,agent
71,12:05,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
71,12:08,"Oh, OK.",agent
71,12:08,"All right, so this is how your typical EG MAD course dashboard looks like.",agent
71,12:12,"One should log in as a student, bunch of learning modules, quizzing, platform, mock test, everything would be there.",agent
71,12:19,"But yeah, we'll, we'll not worry about all of them.",agent
71,12:21,We'll talk about the philosophy of it.,agent
71,12:23,"So step #1 is that you have to take a full-fledged mock test at the beginning of your journey, right?",agent
71,12:31,"Right away, you'll have to take a full-fledged mock test because you want to get to 7:05.",agent
71,12:36,"Fine, we'll get there.",agent
71,12:37,But where are you currently?,agent
71,12:38,Are you at a 555 score?,agent
71,12:39,Are you at a 505?,agent
71,12:41,Are you at a 605495?,agent
71,12:42,Because your starting score will determine the entire action plan for you.,agent
71,12:47,So step #1 you'll have to take a mock test.,agent
71,12:49,"So for example, let me click on this here.",agent
71,12:51,These are the Sigma X mock tests.,agent
71,12:53,"So if you're an AG mad student, you'll go and you'll take the mock test #1 if you look at this student, the student took a mock test, got a 595 to begin with.",agent
71,13:01,He's executed the entire study plan.,agent
71,13:04,Got to 715-7051.,agent
71,13:06,The mock test on the real GMAT as well.,agent
71,13:08,Go to a 705.,agent
71,13:09,That's how your journey would look like.,agent
71,13:10,"Mock test #1 would be a low score, but the other mock test will be high scores because you executed the study plan like that.",agent
71,13:16,"That, that, that is the idea.",agent
71,13:18,Now what we are looking for in mock test number one is you have a 595 score.,agent
71,13:22,"Let's say, OK, fine, 595.",agent
71,13:25,"Within that 595, what is your verbal percentile?",agent
71,13:28,What is your quant percentile?,agent
71,13:30,What is your data insights percentile?,agent
71,13:32,We want to know that.,agent
71,13:33,"Now when I look at this, I can clearly say that this student is naturally weaker on the verbal side, but this guy has good skills by default in data insights.",agent
71,13:42,"Naturally, this guy is stronger there in your case as well.",agent
71,13:45,We'll see.,agent
71,13:46,"Handily speaking, what do you think about your strengths and weaknesses?",agent
71,13:49,"Verbal, quant and data insights, how would they be?",agent
71,13:53,Are you comfortable in quant or verbal?,agent
71,13:56,Verbal and both you're you would be comfortable.,prospect
71,14:01,Is that what you're saying?,agent
71,14:02,Yeah.,prospect
71,14:04,OK.,agent
71,14:04,So there is no specific strength and weaknesses.,agent
71,14:06,Probably everything could be a good area.,agent
71,14:08,That's what you're saying.,agent
71,14:10,Data in text.,prospect
71,14:12,"I, I'm a little confused, but OK, Data insights could be probably a weak area because you're not familiar with those type of questions.",prospect
71,14:22,Maybe.,prospect
71,14:23,"Yeah, that's why probably.",prospect
71,14:24,"OK, we'll see.",agent
71,14:25,"So when you take the mock test, that observation gets quantified.",agent
71,14:29,"So you might get a very low score in data insights in the mock test, but get a good score in verbal and probably we'll see that.",agent
71,14:35,"Now another thing which we which the mock test will tell us is within Verbal in CR and RC, what are the current percentile scores?",agent
71,14:44,"Maybe in Verbal, you are naturally good and critical reasoning, you get a higher starting score, but you are slightly on the weaker side.",agent
71,14:51,"On reading comprehension, we'll get to know that.",agent
71,14:53,"Similarly in quant as well, we'll get to see your percentiles in algebra and arithmetic.",agent
71,14:58,"When you take the real GMAT or a mock test on officialmba.com, you'll get the same results, similar results where all these data points.",agent
71,15:06,"So in the in the EGMAT mock test as well, we are giving all these data points.",agent
71,15:10,So data insights have these four types of sections.,agent
71,15:13,All these sections you'll have starting scores.,agent
71,15:15,This is step number number one.,agent
71,15:16,"Take a mock test, 2 1/2 hours, proper ideals conditions, you'll sit and you'll take a mock test.",agent
71,15:22,This would happen.,agent
71,15:22,This is step number one.,agent
71,15:24,Step #2 is that you'll spend 5 to 10 minutes on this tool called Personalized Study Planner tool.,agent
71,15:30,"It will take the entire mock test score as an input, which will ask you some other questions as well.",agent
71,15:35,"At the end, you will see a framework that looks something like this.",agent
71,15:39,This is the main study plan framework here.,agent
71,15:42,This is the dummy study plan I created for a different student.,agent
71,15:45,I will will not worry about that.,agent
71,15:47,"We'll, we'll worry about the philosophy of it.",agent
71,15:49,What exactly does this mean and why?,agent
71,15:51,Why it is important for you.,agent
71,15:53,"So in this student's case, 545 is the starting score.",agent
71,15:56,This student wants to get to 695.,agent
71,15:58,"In your case, you want to get to 705, little bit higher score, but 695 also is good for us.",agent
71,16:03,"If you get a 695, that's more than good enough.",agent
71,16:06,We'll we'll accept that now.,agent
71,16:09,"Number one is that on the left hand side, you'll see all these current scores.",agent
71,16:15,"This student is slightly stronger in critical reasoning, weaker in reading comprehension, slightly stronger in arithmetic, little bit weaker in algebra.",agent
71,16:24,That's what these numbers mean.,agent
71,16:26,"Now to get to a 695, there are specific targets.",agent
71,16:30,"Because you are stronger in critical reasoning, you are given a bigger target score, and because you are weaker in reading comprehension, you are given a smaller target score.",agent
71,16:39,"So somewhere a very high target score, somewhere slightly lower target score.",agent
71,16:43,But the combination of all these numbers together will give us that 695 the tool determines automatically.,agent
71,16:51,And this is this step is very important because you will get to your overall target in less amount of time.,agent
71,16:57,"If you customize your targets in your stronger area, you need less time to get a higher score.",agent
71,17:02,"In your weaker area, you're not even aiming for a higher score.",agent
71,17:05,So you'll get done faster.,agent
71,17:06,That's the idea.,agent
71,17:07,So this this part is very important.,agent
71,17:10,"Then we, we can actually tell this tool that I can study 4 hours every day, you know, weekends I can study a little bit more amount of time, I can study 38 hours on a weekly basis.",agent
71,17:22,"If I study at that rate, by when can I take the GMAT?",agent
71,17:27,How much time will I need for GMAT?,agent
71,17:28,"For example, this student can take the GMAT by 26th of March at that rate of time investment.",agent
71,17:37,"So if you start the preparation right away, you can take the GMAT by 26th of March.",agent
71,17:41,"But I want to take the GMAT by you, you, I, I means you, you have to take the GMAT by 15th of March or 14th of March, little bit earlier, right?",agent
71,17:52,"So how can, how would you do that?",agent
71,17:54,So what you will have to do is you will have to beat the clock.,agent
71,17:57,"For example, in critical reasoning, it will take about 1 1/2 weeks to get to a 90th percentile.",agent
71,18:03,"1 1/2 weeks is what, 8 days or so.",agent
71,18:05,"So if you start the critical reasoning preparation today, on day eight you will have a 90th percentile, but you need to try and achieve give that 90th percentile not on day 8 but on day six.",agent
71,18:17,You have to save two days time.,agent
71,18:18,"Similarly in reading comprehension, you have to save two days time.",agent
71,18:21,In arithmetic you have to save a couple of days time.,agent
71,18:23,If you do that then you will you will hit that 15th of March deadline.,agent
71,18:28,That is the idea.,agent
71,18:30,"So that that is number 1 #2 let's say you don't have a 545, let's say you have a 605 scores to begin with.",agent
71,18:38,Then then automatically the tool itself will tell you that you can get ready by 13th of March.,agent
71,18:43,"So the more score improvement we need, the more amount of effort it takes to get a higher score.",agent
71,18:50,That that's the only thing.,agent
71,18:51,So that's the idea.,agent
71,18:53,"So if if the if the tool is saying you have to take the GMAT little bit farther than your target GMAT score, the only way to achieve your target by March 15th is by saving some time in every subsection.",agent
71,19:06,That that is the idea.,agent
71,19:07,There.,agent
71,19:08,"Now this part is clear, right?",agent
71,19:10,"The timeline part, yeah.",prospect
71,19:12,"Now coming to the overall execution part of it, because you're a beginner to the preparation as of now.",agent
71,19:20,"In the beginning, first 2-3 weeks, you should try to focus on one thing at a time.",agent
71,19:26,You should not mix things up.,agent
71,19:28,"That means this is how it will go tomorrow, Tomorrow only you'll kind of have to make a decision and start actually, unfortunately we don't have any time.",agent
71,19:35,So I'm saying tomorrow.,agent
71,19:36,Tomorrow you'll start the preparation with verbal.,agent
71,19:38,"Within verbal, you'll start the preparation with critical reasoning.",agent
71,19:41,"And for the next entire one week, only critical reasoning, nothing else.",agent
71,19:46,"No RC, no quant, no data inserts, complete focus on critical reasoning.",agent
71,19:50,"To become an expert in critical reasoning, At the end of that one week, we will give you a bunch of tests.",agent
71,19:56,"In all those tests, you have to get this 90th percentile.",agent
71,19:59,"If that happens, you're done with CR.",agent
71,20:02,"That is the idea there, what what to do in that one week.",agent
71,20:05,I'll show it to you.,agent
71,20:05,But that's the idea.,agent
71,20:06,"So start tomorrow, spend one week on critical reasoning, get to a 90th percentile score, then come to reading comprehension.",agent
71,20:14,"Spend another one week on reading comprehension, get to an 80th percentile score, then go to quant.",agent
71,20:19,"In quant again, you'll spend another two weeks, arithmetic first, then algebra, and you'll try to achieve these target scores.",agent
71,20:25,"But here when you are studying two weeks for quant, you won't you won't just leave verbal aside you during the weekends you will spend little bit more time and take some verbal mock tests.",agent
71,20:39,That way you'll stay in touch with the verbal topic without forgetting about it and the scores also should be good.,agent
71,20:44,Then we'll come to data insights.,agent
71,20:46,"You're not fully familiar with data insights, so we'll spend about 3 weeks or so in data insights and the one topic at a time we'll pick up, We'll try to achieve the target scores.",agent
71,20:55,"And while doing data insights for three weeks, every weekend you will take verbal and quant sectional mock test together back-to-back.",agent
71,21:04,So that way you are trying to build the stamina for the main test as well.,agent
71,21:07,Every year earlier you handled only verbal tests.,agent
71,21:10,Now we are adding quant tests into the mix.,agent
71,21:12,Then we will add data data insert tests into the mix as well.,agent
71,21:16,Then finally we'll take the full length mock tests like that.,agent
71,21:19,"So in the EG MAT course, you have about 55 zero sectional mock tests.",agent
71,21:24,"You won't take all of them, no need to take all of them, but they are there and you have the full length mock tests as well.",agent
71,21:29,"So that's how it is how, how to divide the next 1 1/2 month.",agent
71,21:33,"That was clear, right?",agent
71,21:34,"Two weeks for verbal, 2 weeks for quant, 3 weeks for data inserts like that.",agent
71,21:37,"OK, now let's go to the execution part.",agent
71,21:42,So I said start the preparation tomorrow with critical reasoning and with verbal and within one week wrap it up.,agent
71,21:49,So exactly how that one week would look like.,agent
71,21:51,I'll give you that understanding.,agent
71,21:53,That way you'll have a much more clearer picture.,agent
71,21:55,"So whatever the learning architecture that we discussed for critical reasoning right now, the learning architecture remains same for every other topic as well.",agent
71,22:05,So that that that part is there.,agent
71,22:07,Now let's go and see the critical reasoning part.,agent
71,22:10,So let's go to this verbal and master.,agent
71,22:15,So critical reasoning is here.,agent
71,22:17,We'll have to start the preparation with critical reasoning.,agent
71,22:21,Right now we are interested in learning a bunch of things and practicing a bunch of things in critical reasoning.,agent
71,22:28,Then we will do the testing part.,agent
71,22:29,The stage #2 is the testing part.,agent
71,22:31,Stage number one is the learning practice part.,agent
71,22:34,"And before critical reasoning, you will notice there is a foundation module called master comprehension.",agent
71,22:40,"Let's say you took a mock test tomorrow morning, and in the mock test, your verbal score came out to be slightly lower.",agent
71,22:47,Slightly lower means 40 percentile or 50 percentile or lower than that.,agent
71,22:52,That means basics and foundation is not good.,agent
71,22:55,"So we have to start the preparation from basics and foundation, which is called master comprehension.",agent
71,22:59,That's the idea.,agent
71,23:00,Let's say tomorrow in the mock test you got a 70 percentile in verbal.,agent
71,23:04,Then we don't need to worry about the basics.,agent
71,23:06,"So it it really depends on the starting score right now, I'm assuming that I know you're just new to the GMAT and beginner.",agent
71,23:14,Probably you may get a little bit lower score.,agent
71,23:16,"I'm assuming that if you get a good score tomorrow, I'm I'll be very happy.",agent
71,23:19,But but that we'll discuss based on as if you're going to get a little bit lower score.,agent
71,23:23,"So master comprehension, you'll spend some time, you'll do the entire foundation module properly, you'll understand, and you'll take some of these quizzes and everything.",agent
71,23:32,"Once that is quickly done, we'll move on to critical reasoning.",agent
71,23:35,"So in critical reasoning, you have all these 10 topics, inference, assumptions, strengthen, weaken, boldface.",agent
71,23:41,These are all the topics.,agent
71,23:43,Your goal is to build expertise in all these topics in the next one week.,agent
71,23:50,"Day one, day 2, day three, day four, day 5, all these topics need to be done in five days or so.",agent
71,23:55,"That that is, that is the idea now.",agent
71,23:57,Now the good The thing is whenever you open a so there are two things you have to do these topics in the right sequence.,agent
71,24:05:00,"First you have to learn what is premise, what is conclusion.",agent
71,24:09:00,Then you have to learn what is inference.,agent
71,24:10:00,Then you have to figure out how to find assumptions.,agent
71,24:13:00,"Then evaluate strength and we can in that sequence only you have to do if you skip the sequence, it will be very logical way of studying.",agent
71,24:20:00,So that will be a big problem.,agent
71,24:22:00,That's that's that sequence is very important and these kind of sequences and all will not be there in that OG book.,agent
71,24:28:00,That OG book is straightforward practice.,agent
71,24:30:00,That's why I'm recommending not to do that alone.,agent
71,24:33:00,"Then whenever you open a topic, you'll see a bunch of files here.",agent
71,24:37:00,But there is a right way of doing here.,agent
71,24:39:00,"For example, this 2.1 to 2.5, these are all concept video lessons each 20 minutes video lesson would be there.",agent
71,24:45:00,"So concept video lessons will try to teach the theoretical part of it, what is inference, So how to do it, how to visualize all those things theoretical part.",agent
71,24:53:00,"Now, the most important thing here is every video lesson after 20 minutes, it ends with a quiz that you have to take that quiz and I need to see a very good score, 80 percent, 90% or 100%, something like that.",agent
71,25:05:00,That has to happen.,agent
71,25:06:00,That that that is the idea.,agent
71,25:07:00,"If you are getting very good scores, then obviously you're doing well.",agent
71,25:12:00,"If you get a low score, let's say you did a video lesson, you got a low score, 40 percent, 50%.",agent
71,25:18:00,That means you did not understand this concept.,agent
71,25:21:00,It is an explicit feedback.,agent
71,25:23:00,"You have to do something about that, that if you get a low score, redo the video lesson, try to get a better understanding of it or look at the solutions of the questions that you got incorrect and try to understand why exactly you, you, you went wrong.",agent
71,25:34:00,"While while solving those questions, you have to put in that additional effort.",agent
71,25:38:00,"When you put in that additional effort, you will take these couple of additional practice quizzes.",agent
71,25:44:00,"There I need to see 80 percent, 80%.",agent
71,25:46:00,"If you get a 40% score here, that's OK, as long as you get 80 percent, 80% here, that's the idea.",agent
71,25:52:00,"So learn something, do the test.",agent
71,25:54:00,"If the test is bad, relearn it, take a fresh test and get a good score, continuous loop.",agent
71,26:01:00,So that's what we'll do.,agent
71,26:03:00,Then comes application video lessons.,agent
71,26:05:00,"Till now you learnt the theory of inference, you know the theory, but how do you solve the questions?",agent
71,26:11:00,"When you see a question, what is your step one?",agent
71,26:13:00,What is your Step 2?,agent
71,26:14:00,What is your step three?,agent
71,26:15:00,"That step by step method you have to learn from this application video lessons again, they'll there will be quizzes at the end.",agent
71,26:22:00,"You have to get 80 percent, 90%, eighty percent, 90%, something like that.",agent
71,26:26:00,"If that happens, that means you are able to solve the questions.",agent
71,26:29:00,"You, you know the theory, you know the method and the method is working for you.",agent
71,26:34:00,That's what it would mean.,agent
71,26:35:00,"At that point, we will do immediately some additional practice and you'll have to get all good scores That, that, that is the idea there.",agent
71,26:42:00,"So all these numbers together, they're telling me a story about your your performance in the topic inference, whether you are an expert in inference or still some weaknesses there in inference or do we have to do the entire inference Once again, something whatever it is, we'll get to know from these numbers.",agent
71,26:58:00,That is the idea.,agent
71,27:00:00,"So clear till now, right?",agent
71,27:02:00,Yeah.,prospect
71,27:03:00,"Oh, OK, that is good.",agent
71,27:04:00,And each and every topic as well will be like that.,agent
71,27:07:00,"Only whichever topic you open, you'll have to do the concept, application, practice quizzes and you'll have to get all these good scores.",agent
71,27:14:00,That is the one topic at a time.,agent
71,27:15:00,"So day one, inference and assumption over day 2, evaluate and strengthen over.",agent
71,27:20:00,"Day three, weekend is over, Day 4, boldface is over.",agent
71,27:23:00,"So in 5-6 days, you have to wrap up the entire thing.",agent
71,27:26:00,I mean that we have to do that oral.,agent
71,27:28:00,We don't have much choice there.,agent
71,27:30:00,"Now one one additional step here is that in the EG MAT course, whenever you are taking these bunch of quizzes, you kind of have to figure out whether the score is good or not.",agent
71,27:41:00,"For example, this 50% may be a good score actually, because the quiz is very difficult here.",agent
71,27:46:00,This 86% may not be a good score because this quiz may be easier.,agent
71,27:51:00,So there could be some differences like that.,agent
71,27:53:00,So what we do is we have this some tool called Journey View.,agent
71,27:57:00,"Whenever you take a quiz here, you will compare yourself with other people.",agent
71,28:02:00,"For example, in this particular quiz application tool, everybody else on the EG MAP platform on an average got 50% score.",agent
71,28:10:00,You got a 75% score.,agent
71,28:12:00,That means you are outperforming others.,agent
71,28:14:00,That's what we want.,agent
71,28:15:00,So grade is a grade.,agent
71,28:16:00,A grade means you are performing better than others.,agent
71,28:19:00,B grade means you are performing exactly same as others.,agent
71,28:22:00,Other people got 75.,agent
71,28:23:00,You also got 75.,agent
71,28:25:00,"That 75 number looks bigger, but it's not really a great score.",agent
71,28:29:00,That's what it is.,agent
71,28:30:00,Grade B means grade C means you are performing lower than others.,agent
71,28:35:00,That's when you have to redo the entire video lesson.,agent
71,28:38:00,So grade A grade B is fine.,agent
71,28:41:00,Fine.,agent
71,28:41:00,Grade C is not fine at all.,agent
71,28:43:00,That that is the idea.,agent
71,28:44:00,"And when you do the entire critical reasoning course completely in the next 5-6 days, you will see these learning level grades as well.",agent
71,28:51:00,All the topics will be clubbed into 4 levels and overall you are getting A grade.,agent
71,28:56:00,"All these 4A grades me, your account should look like this.",agent
71,28:59:00,I need to see all A grades.,agent
71,29:00:00,That means your preparation has been done very well.,agent
71,29:03:00,"You know all the concepts of critical reasoning, you know the right method to solve the questions, and you have solved A bunch of questions, and the method is working for you.",agent
71,29:11:00,That means you're getting all A grades.,agent
71,29:13:00,"So if you get all A grades, that means you're almost done with CR.",agent
71,29:17:00,You're ready for CR.,agent
71,29:18:00,"If I see B grade, C grade, something like that, that means no, you're not done with CR.",agent
71,29:22:00,Still you have problems.,agent
71,29:24:00,That's the idea.,agent
71,29:26:00,"These grades are an indicator for us till now, clear, right?",agent
71,29:29:00,The overall philosophy of it.,agent
71,29:31:00,"So you start with critical reasoning in that you have a target of five days to complete critical reasoning we have, we have to wrap up each and every topic.",agent
71,29:38:00,"In each topic you have the theory lessons, application lessons, practice quizzes and get all good scores.",agent
71,29:43:00,That's the idea now.,agent
71,29:47:00,"So we said you have to get to a 90th percentile score in about one week or so, 8 days or so, five days, six days you have spent on the learning aspects and practice aspects, whatever we have discussed till now.",agent
71,30:00:00,5-6 days you took the next two days you have to do assessments.,agent
71,30:05:00,So that's what we will discuss.,agent
71,30:06:00,"Now you will go to this quizzing platform, Wordbill Scholaranium.",agent
71,30:09:00,"So you can actually follow these instructions as it is because I'll give you the video recording, I'll do the I'll give you this.",agent
71,30:15:00,"But yeah, so you'll have to go to this Verbal Scholar Indium quizzing platform.",agent
71,30:19:00,"You will, you will take something called cementing quizzes.",agent
71,30:23:00,These are the standardized quizzes here in Critical Reasoning.,agent
71,30:27:00,"You will have to take about 3 to 4 medium difficulty level quizzes, three to four very hard difficulty level quizzes as well.",agent
71,30:34:00,"And the platform will give you some target scores, like you want to get to 90th percentile in critical reasoning.",agent
71,30:43:00,"That means in hard level questions, at least 70% accuracy should be there.",agent
71,30:48:00,"In medium level questions, at least 90% accuracy should be there.",agent
71,30:52:00,"You when you take these bunch of quizzes, you have to hit all those targets.",agent
71,30:56:00,"5, you took 5 medium difficulty level quizzes, 9090909090.",agent
71,31:01:00,"You took five hard difficulty level quizzes, 70%, Seventy percent, 70 percent, 70%.",agent
71,31:06:00,"If this happens, you're actually done with critical reasoning that that that is the idea there and you will actually see all those scores and, and this kind of graphs and all will be parted.",agent
71,31:17:00,"For example, this is the student who took the medium difficulty level quizzes for critical reasoning.",agent
71,31:23:00,"This guy's target is set at 70% and quiz number one, this guy got 50%.",agent
71,31:30:00,That's why we are calling it fail.,agent
71,31:31:00,You have failed in that particular quiz.,agent
71,31:33:00,That's OK.,agent
71,31:34:00,"If here in this particular quizzing stage, if you're getting lower scores, it's completely OK.",agent
71,31:40:00,That's why we are reserving 2 days or three days for this entire stage.,agent
71,31:44:00,"Because what we will do is if you get low scores, you'll go to the skill data section and within critical reasoning at a topic level, you can actually see what is happening.",agent
71,31:53:00,"Like whenever we give you questions from this particular topic, your scores are very good.",agent
71,31:57:00,"But whenever we give you questions from this boldfest topic, your score is not good.",agent
71,32:01:00,"In hard difficulty level, there is a red flag.",agent
71,32:03:00,You're getting lower.,agent
71,32:04:00,"Of course, in medium difficulty level, score is OK, timing is bad.",agent
71,32:08:00,We can see that here.,agent
71,32:09:00,"So you if you get a low score, you would identify the weak area here.",agent
71,32:14:00,You would work on the weak area.,agent
71,32:15:00,How would you work on the weak area?,prospect
71,32:16:00,"You would have to go back and do the learning modules once again, revise them.",agent
71,32:20:00,You'll have to analyze the solutions of the questions that you got incorrect here.,agent
71,32:24:00,Spend some time on the solutions and try and figure out where did I go wrong?,agent
71,32:28:00,"And once the traditional effort is put in, then we will take a fresh set of quizzes.",agent
71,32:32:00,"So that's what, that's why you can see this, right?",agent
71,32:34:00,Quiz #150% looked at the weak areas and revised them on the same day.,agent
71,32:39:00,"Quiz #270% again did the looked at the weak areas and worked on them, then got 90% and 90%.",agent
71,32:47:00,So the target is set at 70%.,agent
71,32:49:00,"This guy is getting 90 percent, 90%, so done.",agent
71,32:51:00,Obviously this guy has improved.,agent
71,32:53:00,"Then this guy went to the hard difficulty level quizzes, weak areas are already addressed in medium difficulty practice.",agent
71,32:59:00,"So in the hard difficulty there is consistency, 70%, sixty percent, 70 percent, 60%.",agent
71,33:04:00,Target is at 55%.,agent
71,33:06:00,This guy is getting 60 and 80%.,agent
71,33:08:00,"So fine, completely good.",agent
71,33:09:00,So there is improvement and then there is consistency.,agent
71,33:13:00,"CR is over that, that, that, that.",agent
71,33:16:00,That is the idea.,agent
71,33:17:00,That's the philosophy we are looking at.,agent
71,33:20:00,Seven days is over within.,agent
71,33:22:00,"So all these things will take about 8 days in your specific case, but we need to try to wrap it up in six days, five days, five and half days or so.",agent
71,33:31:00,"That way we can do faster, but that that's the only thing.",agent
71,33:35:00,"So, and once that CR is done, we'll go to RC.",agent
71,33:38:00,"We'll, you'll execute the same thing actually.",agent
71,33:40:00,"Then you'll go to data insights, you'll do the same thing for each topic.",agent
71,33:44:00,"You'll do the learning modules, then the quizzing platform, you'll do the learning modules and then you'll do the quizzing platform.",agent
71,33:50:00,Score should be good.,agent
71,33:51:00,"And every, every weekend you will take this sectional mock tests that, that, that, that that will happen.",agent
71,33:56:00,"So all these things you would do, but you will not be doing it by yourself.",agent
71,34:03:00,"Actually, when you become an EG mad student, you would be assigned a dedicated mentor in the beginning of your journey.",agent
71,34:10:00,And the mentor's job is to give you all these instructions in a continuous way.,agent
71,34:15:00,"Like for example, tomorrow you start the course, tomorrow morning you'll get a set of instructions from your mentor.",agent
71,34:20:00,"Hey, I want you to start with verbal.",agent
71,34:22:00,"I want you to start with master comprehension, complete it and come back to me.",agent
71,34:26:00,"You'll execute it and you'll tell you, you'll drop an e-mail to your mentor saying that hey, I completed it.",agent
71,34:31:00,"And at that point, your mentor would log into your account.",agent
71,34:35:00,"They will see master comprehension, how well she did the course.",agent
71,34:38:00,"All 100% scores are there, everything looks good.",prospect
71,34:41:00,Then your mentor would give you the next set of instructions.,agent
71,34:43:00,"You just have to follow them, which causes to take, what scores to get, when to take, when not to take, all those things.",agent
71,34:51:00,"Actually, you'll get to see it from the mentor.",agent
71,34:52:00,"So actually you can see it here, let's say if you go to EG MAT YouTube channel, you'll see all these bunch of success stories, many of them are first time test takers as well.",agent
71,35:03:00,Here this is the mentor the student is having an interview with here.,agent
71,35:08:00,"If you see this is another mentor, you can see that.",agent
71,35:10:00,"So, yeah, EG MAT by default we I mean in terms of delivering number of success stories, EG MAT delivers three times more success stories than any other test prep company.",agent
71,35:20:00,You should definitely consider a course and EG Mat should you should evaluate EG MAT if you find another course to be little bit better.,agent
71,35:27:00,It's completely fine.,agent
71,35:28:00,This is a student who got to 655 in 30 days if you say it.,agent
71,35:31:00,So she kind of kind of like your journey only we are expecting there.,agent
71,35:36:00,"So yeah, you can go through all these success to some of these success stories and all you can do that.",agent
71,35:42:00,"But yeah, that that is the idea.",agent
71,35:43:00,"And yeah, so this is the overall journey that you would go through and it will so far.",agent
71,35:51:00,"I, I want to say one thing for sure here, it won't be a easy journey.",agent
71,35:57:00,The relative easiness of this 45 day journey will really depend upon your starting score.,agent
71,36:05:00,"If your starting score is 545 or something like that, yes, we can get this done.",agent
71,36:11:00,"If your starting score is 615605, then definitely we can get it done.",agent
71,36:17:00,"If your starting score is 445 or 435, something like that, it becomes very tough journey.",agent
71,36:24:00,"Yeah, to get it done So that, that, that, that is there and and what is that?",agent
71,36:30:00,Because you have to wrap it up in 45 days.,agent
71,36:33:00,You don't have the luxury to take any breaks.,agent
71,36:35:00,"Every day we have to study, let's say on a particular Monday, you could not study.",agent
71,36:41:00,You should be in a position to take a vacation day on a Friday and put in more amount of time from office and work.,agent
71,36:47:00,Those sacrifices will have to be made.,agent
71,36:50:00,"The, the, the, those kind of things will will have to happen and you have to plan for it.",agent
71,36:55:00,"And of course, you have unlimited strategy support over e-mail with your mentor.",agent
71,36:58:00,So you can always get that recommendation from your mentor.,agent
71,37:01:00,Should I take vacation days?,agent
71,37:03:00,How many days should I take?,agent
71,37:04:00,How much more time do I need?,agent
71,37:05:00,All those questions?,agent
71,37:06:00,Your mentor will be able to help you.,agent
71,37:08:00,"But yeah, that is the idea.",agent
71,37:09:00,"That's the philosophy, That's the framework that you have to go through.",agent
71,37:12:00,Let me know if you have any questions.,agent
71,37:15:00,"No, as of now, I'm thinking of a course.",prospect
71,37:17:00,"I'll go through everything and then definitely and I'll also share, give you this information right away.",agent
71,37:26:00,That way you don't have to waste any time.,agent
71,37:28:00,"So if you go to the EG MAD plans and pricing page of there are two-month, 4 month, 6 month options, obviously you'll have to go with the two-month option because we have to do it in 45 days.",agent
71,37:39:00,It's at $199 on the website.,agent
71,37:42:00,Tomorrow the same course will be at 1:59.,agent
71,37:45:00,So there is a discount that will come up tomorrow.,agent
71,37:47:00,You can use that and you can get started as well.,agent
71,37:49:00,"So OK, and I won't, I will not let you wait till tomorrow after our call.",agent
71,37:56:00,I'll go and I'll get an approval to offer the same 159 link right away that way because you don't have any much time to think about.,agent
71,38:03:00,So I'll send the link over e-mail.,agent
71,38:05:00,"If you decide tomorrow morning or so, you can use that and you can get started.",agent
71,38:10:00,OK.,prospect
71,38:11:00,"Oh, that is there.",agent
71,38:12:00,"So yeah, make a decision as soon as possible and get started.",agent
71,38:16:00,And I'll send you some case studies and that link over e-mail.,agent
71,38:19:00,I'll message you on WhatsApp.,agent
71,38:21:00,Any other questions after the call?,agent
71,38:22:00,Ping me on WhatsApp.,agent
71,38:23:00,I'll take care of it.,agent
71,38:24:00,OK.,prospect
71,38:26:00,Thank you.,prospect
71,38:26:00,Thank you so much.,prospect
71,38:27:00,All right then.,agent
71,38:28:00,Not a problem.,agent
71,38:28:00,Have a good day.,agent
71,38:29:00,Bye.,prospect
71,38:30:00,Bye.,agent
71,38:31:00,Bye.,prospect
88,07:29,"Hello, hello, hey .",unknown
88,07:37,"Yes, yeah.",unknown
88,07:39,So you know the call has been pushing since couple of days so finally happened so with this call.,agent
88,07:49,"So this call is majorly for clearing whatever queries you have, you know, just to give you complete clarity of whatever you would like to understand.",agent
88,08:00,"No, I have gone through the, I have gone through few CR videos which were free of free.",prospect
88,08:09,"Yeah, yeah, I have gone through them.",prospect
88,08:11,And also I think that session was pushed because of those mock.,prospect
88,08:17,I was unable to even find a suitable time and able to connect.,prospect
88,08:21,So I gave the mock yesterday.,prospect
88,08:23,"I think I have gone through the video also that about what is provided in the course and I am and I think I can put in weekly few hours for this prep and mainly how many hours how you are planning, how many hours on a weekly basis, how you are planning?",prospect
88,08:44,I can put 21 to 22 hours I think good enough good enough good enough good enough.,agent
88,08:52,So I think I can manage with that.,prospect
88,08:54,And from yesterdays mock I think which would be very similar to what the actual exam would be.,prospect
88,09:02,"I think I need to be I need to practice more on verbal and quads, verbal and data insights.",prospect
88,09:10,"Sorry, Sir, verbal and data insights quads I think I was not able to do mostly because I have forgotten most of the concepts I just can review and I can do.",prospect
88,09:23,But actually I will planning.,prospect
88,09:25,"I think I have, I think I have shared with you that I am planning to give GMAT because I am interested for the one year programs in the Iams that will happen from the applications for which will open from April I think, right, It will be opening from April.",prospect
88,09:42,"Yeah, you would have deadline for a couple of months.",agent
88,09:45,"Yeah, till October I think.",agent
88,09:47,"I think I will have the deadline, yeah, yeah.",prospect
88,09:52,So just have to the official announcement yet to come on the deadline.,agent
88,09:57,Yeah.,agent
88,09:57,"So once once it comes, you can just check, check the route as well.",agent
88,10:02,"Anyway if regarding what colleges I can apply with this course or what are the colleges, what are the application forms that were coming and I should apply Is there will the yeah, just looking for only India, right.",prospect
88,10:15,Only India right?,agent
88,10:17,For now I have plans only in India.,prospect
88,10:21,I have not heard any of the quotes that will be NCR.,agent
88,10:24,Singapore would be a good choice for you apart from India if you are looking.,agent
88,10:29,NCR does say with the highest cost so you know.,agent
88,10:32,I have sent you a couple of videos.,agent
88,10:33,You remember this 210 improvement and 675675700 plus also.,agent
88,10:41,So you know with with A685695 score you can apply for INSEAD also INSEAD is among the top 10 schools across the globe and Singapore.,agent
88,10:52,It is in Singapore.,agent
88,10:53,So really good return on investment.,agent
88,10:56,Lot of scholarship options.,agent
88,10:58,"ISVISB may sound like a very hefty fees and all these things but it is going to be cheaper than I, I, Ms if you have a really good gmatch score because ISV gives up to 100% scholarship in round one application.",agent
88,11:13,So there are multiple rounds of application that happens in this top schools.,agent
88,11:17,So we have to look for round one where they will be.,agent
88,11:20,So as the round progress Round 2 and round 3 they will be more choosy and the the scholarship will also be lesser.,agent
88,11:26,But round one gives up to the round one application.,agent
88,11:30,Deadlines are mostly till when the 15th September around around 15th September plus or -5 days most of the schools even inside also around mid of September is when most schools have the round one deadline.,agent
88,11:46,"The round one was before one year MBA timber, the application round one deadline.",prospect
88,11:51,The round one deadlines are around September for all major items mid of September.,agent
88,11:56,"OK, OK, so I am not I am you have to check particularly they they just sometimes they just go one month up and down and up and down.",prospect
88,12:03,So you just have to check based on the outcome.,agent
88,12:06,"But the ISBNCR, all the schools with the standard process no, since years for them it is it is going to be at that time only.",agent
88,12:14,So it has been since years they have changed.,agent
88,12:16,So you don't expect this year.,agent
88,12:18,Also the deadline is going to be the same around mid of September.,agent
88,12:23,"If would be better if I plan to give my exam in the month of July only, it would be July only.",prospect
88,12:31,"July, June, July you have to give some ample time so that because you have prep you are going to give 20 hours of study to take time till June, July to completely get done with the whole element and to get to that particular high score.",agent
88,12:45,We are not settling for.,agent
88,12:46,See the median score for ISBI Ms and all are 655665 which is a 92% and 93%.,agent
88,12:56,We shouldn't settle for that.,agent
88,12:57,"We should look for pushing it to a 98 kind of percentile, 9798 percentile.",agent
88,13:03,So 695 kind of a score 685695 is something which we need to push ourselves because right now you have the advantage of time.,agent
88,13:12,You are not thankfully you are not in the month of April or May sitting and talking to me or we are discussing about the prep right now.,agent
88,13:19,"You are, you are at least way ahead of a lot of students who decide later on.",agent
88,13:24,"So that is the advantage that you have got and you can, you need not push for 30 hours, 40 hours right now because that is not required.",agent
88,13:31,"But if you have someone who is at this capability and that end of April or something, you would have to push it way harder like 35 hours of prep time per week to eventually even think of getting there.",agent
88,13:46,Yeah.,prospect
88,13:47,"So I if I take the 4 months, 4 months course is that will be enough for this?",prospect
88,13:57,The rate I am the current score which I have got 4 months is good enough.,agent
88,14:05,Provided every week you are consistently giving in that particular study time and you are very consistent without a break of even a week because it will be a close space.,agent
88,14:14,"But suppose if you want to suppose in the 4 months of time you are already at a So now it is starting so March, April, May and June.",agent
88,14:23,So that will be June.,agent
88,14:24,"If you want to extend it for one more month later on, you can do an extension at a nominal cost of $89.",agent
88,14:30,It will be around ?7000 kind of for one month extension.,agent
88,14:34,"At that point of time, if required, you can do that.",agent
88,14:37,OK yeah.,prospect
88,14:39,So I don't think if I take the 6 months course I have enough time to at least prep for that because I am planning because because it will be end of July then August because I am planning.,prospect
88,15:01,I I just lost you.,agent
88,15:03,Your your voice.,agent
88,15:04,Just Hello Adesha.,agent
88,15:19,Hello.,agent
88,15:27,If I am audible.,prospect
88,15:29,"Yeah, Yeah.",agent
88,15:29,Now you are.,agent
88,15:29,Now you are audible.,agent
88,15:30,"Yes, yes, you audible.",agent
88,15:32,"OK, so you are asking something I think I was asking that only that 4I would like to go for the 4 months course only because 6 months would stretch a long time.",prospect
88,15:45,"I&I don't think I don't have enough time to prep for 6 months and then we give the exam, correct?",prospect
88,15:52,Correct.,agent
88,15:53,"4 months is the suitable option for you, $99 right?",agent
88,16:02,One month is $99 like $89 after extension.,agent
88,16:09,"4 months is 4 months course is you know priced at 2:00, $99 which is around 25,500 for 4 months.",agent
88,16:20,"That's the pricing yeah yeah, I got it, I got it.",prospect
88,16:25,I will I will go for the 4 months only and if required then I will just extend it for one month.,prospect
88,16:31,The one thing that was not mentioned in the video I think the mock test thing.,prospect
88,16:38,Can you please just brief me once because I don't think the mocks thing is properly explained.,prospect
88,16:45,I have seen the video can you just so I will I will show you as well.,agent
88,16:50,So you will have 5 full length adaptive test which is you know computer adaptive test.,agent
88,16:54,You are going to have 5 full length apart from that you are going to have 90 plus sectional mocks.,agent
88,17:00,You are going to find around 60 plus from our portal itself and you are going to have around you know 40 from GMAT.,agent
88,17:08,So you know that is for your extra practice.,agent
88,17:11,"We are it is a $70 worth of you know GMAT club, you know sectional test which we are purchasing and giving you for free of cost along with the course so that you don't need to go anywhere beyond for anything.",agent
88,17:23,So you get everything in a single place.,agent
88,17:25,So that's why we are doing that.,agent
88,17:28,"So apart from that access to GMAT, GMAT Club will be there to me for the 4 months GMAT that will be for 3 months that access is there for 3 months the because that is not provided by us.",agent
88,17:43,We are purchasing and giving it to you that is like so that is something which we purchase and give it to you.,agent
88,17:48,"So maybe you can you know so you can activate it, you can reach out to the support team they will activate it for you and then it will be valid for 3 months so you can utilise it.",agent
88,17:57,So here is where you would find cementing question which is like sub sectional mock.,agent
88,18:01,It is not just sectional that we have.,agent
88,18:02,"We also have sub sectional mocks just for CR, just for RC.",agent
88,18:06,"If you look at quant you further bifurcate arithmetic into number of properties, what problems advanced topic for the detailed analysis and then data insights again you would have sub sectional mark if you if you just see they will have topic wise MSRGITATPA data sufficiency.",agent
88,18:22,And then you have sectional which is suppose if you take verbal you are going to have sectional mocks.,agent
88,18:28,So this is the sectional mocks that you would have section on section.,agent
88,18:31,So the first sectional mock is not adaptive it is called condensed sectional mark for improving your accuracy and here you will have normal sectional mark which is adapted.,agent
88,18:39,So we are the only platform which gives adaptive sectional mark.,agent
88,18:43,Like if you take a sectional mark here you are going to have like the exact replica of your vowel section 45 minutes adaptive you are going to attempt and you would see that what is your score.,agent
88,18:53,So that is a very big advantage that you are going to have.,agent
88,18:56,"And then once that is done the same way for cons and data and sets also, you are going to have the sectional marks accordingly.",agent
88,19:01,"You would find here which is the section mark count, right?",agent
88,19:04,So you are going to have a high volume of sectional box.,agent
88,19:08,And apart from that you are also going to have you know custom quizzes.,agent
88,19:12,So what is the significance of custom quizzes?,agent
88,19:15,So you can do targeted learning within CR.,agent
88,19:17,"So we go to that level where within CR you can actually create custom quiz just for inference, just for evaluate, just for this particular topics also.",agent
88,19:26,"And another advantage of this custom quizzes is towards the last end of your prep, you can actually create a whole question bank out of all the incorrect questions from day one till the end.",agent
88,19:36,It will be catalogued and you can create a whole question Bank of incorrect questions which would be a very high value question pool for you.,agent
88,19:43,And that too topic wise you can get.,agent
88,19:46,So that is a big advantage.,agent
88,19:47,"And then you know a lot of analytics that you get you would be a bit overwhelmed by it, but the idea is you would have a dedicated mentor who would be guiding you through year prep.",agent
88,19:58,"So yes, exactly this was this was a lot of information that you gave me and I think I have grasped only a few about the different types of test and what I need to do.",prospect
88,20:08,I think I don't have to be worried.,prospect
88,20:10,"Yeah, I think once if I involve you would be able to guide me better regarding what to give first and how to proceed.",prospect
88,20:20,Yeah.,agent
88,20:21,And you don't see the.,agent
88,20:23,So we have mentorship in 2 phases that is.,agent
88,20:26,Phase one till you reach a 615 and Phase 2 is last mile push program which you would be enrolled free of cost.,agent
88,20:33,That is by default part of the program where you would be getting one on one live session like teams call.,agent
88,20:39,We would be correcting but before that all the communication till you reach that capability it will be through email and chat support.,agent
88,20:46,This is like the Facebook Messenger like whenever you your mentor pings you would get a pop up.,agent
88,20:50,When you ping them they get a pop up.,agent
88,20:51,You don't have to take the headache of sending a mail and all the things you are going to get it here itself.,agent
88,20:57,"And another advantage is whatever you communicate here, you are going to get a copy of it in your WhatsApp also like not in the WhatsApp the email as well the same whatever communication you have here, you are going to have a copy of it in your email so that that will be documented for you.",agent
88,21:13,"OK, OK.",prospect
88,21:15,"I think once I the mentorship program in the first phase, how frequent it is to guide me how, how should I proceed with the completion of you don't have any.",prospect
88,21:25,So from day one your mentor would be assigned.,agent
88,21:27,"Suppose if you are taking the course today, within 24 hours, a mentor would be assigned to you.",agent
88,21:32,"And once a mentor is assigned, they are going to give you set of tasks that you have to do.",agent
88,21:36,You are going to do those tasks based on their instruction and guidance.,agent
88,21:40,You are going to do that.,agent
88,21:42,"Once you are done with that, they would evaluate you and they, they would say that give you a feedback and then you are going to do the next set of task which they give.",agent
88,21:49,So it will be a task based approach that you will be going through.,agent
88,21:51,Of course you are going to have you are going to create a study plan.,agent
88,21:54,"So the moment you enroll, you will see a set of onboarding videos and guide guiding videos with which we would be creating this study plan on an everyday what has to be done.",agent
88,22:03,"You would get a clarity, but this is skeleton.",agent
88,22:05,The flesh on the skin is going to be your mentor who who build that on on top of your prep.,agent
88,22:11,So you are going to have a very clear clarity.,agent
88,22:12,How many hours of verbal prep is required?,agent
88,22:14,How many hours of corn prep?,agent
88,22:15,"How many hours of you know, data inside prep?",agent
88,22:19,"And when you say that you would be finished, you would get a complete clarity accordingly.",agent
88,22:22,"You can accelerate, decelerate your prep, all this things would happen.",agent
88,22:27,"Yeah, I got OK.",prospect
88,22:29,"Yeah, I got it.",prospect
88,22:32,I got it.,prospect
88,22:33,I will do that.,prospect
88,22:35,"So, yeah.",prospect
88,22:36,"So this is our, you know, GMAT club within GMAT club, you know, if you just look at our reviews, you would find and and I have just put the filter for the last mail push program.",agent
88,22:46,"So in the last mail push you would see, you know, all the people talking about how the last mail push has been helpful and you would also be part of it, but not the starting itself.",agent
88,22:53,"But of course, once you reach that particular level, it see how the last time push program help.",agent
88,22:58,So you just read this.,agent
88,22:59,I especially love the Olympic program where they provide you a mentor and personalise that it's at no extra cost.,agent
88,23:04,So you know that that is something which is there and condition is you are already at a good level.,agent
88,23:09,The good level is around A615625 score.,agent
88,23:12,So so you know how it helps.,agent
88,23:14,So that that is that is the whole thing.,agent
88,23:16,"Almost everybody the in the video, what did it see?",agent
88,23:19,Everyone is part of last minute push by default that is part of the course offering.,agent
88,23:23,"OK, Yeah, OK.",prospect
88,23:26,I will just I think I will enroll for this program because I have already pushed it a lot.,prospect
88,23:34,"Yeah, I will enroll for this program in by today or by tomorrow only and I will start my prep as soon as possible.",prospect
88,23:43,Since you decided to start by today or tomorrow.,agent
88,23:47,"I, I, I, I would like to say that we also have some discounts running on the price which you can avail since it will be there for only for a limited time.",agent
88,23:54,"So since you have already decided to purchase with tomorrow, so I, we generally don't push people to purchase with the discount.",agent
88,24:00:00,"So since you have decided for that, I, I help you with that discount coupon as well for, for, for the purchase.",agent
88,24:07:00,So basically it is a $299 the course for 4 months you would get a $50 off.,agent
88,24:14:00,So you are going to get it for a 249.,agent
88,24:16:00,So yeah.,agent

88,25:36:00,But the mental assignment is a manual process which we have to initiate.,agent
88,25:39:00,"So you know, the sooner the better.",agent
88,25:42:00,"So I once you once I buy the course, I will ping you in WhatsApp regarding the payment details so that you can you don't have to send me any screen you don't have to send me anything.",prospect

88,26:11:00,Your went as sending so that is why I am so I will I will help you with the onboarding where you would have to send a mail with your score.,agent

88,26:31:00,OK.,prospect
88,26:32:00,Thank you.,prospect
88,26:33:00,Yeah.,agent
88,26:33:00,Alright.,agent
88,26:34:00,See you then.,agent
88,26:34:00,Take care.,agent
88,26:35:00,Have a nice thank you.,agent
88,26:37:00,Yeah.,unknown
8,00:12,Hello.,agent
8,00:13,Hello.,prospect
8,00:13,"Hi, Amruth.",prospect
8,00:14,How are you?,agent
8,00:15,"Hey, Siddh, I'm good.",agent
8,00:16,Thanks for asking.,agent
8,00:17,How are you?,agent
8,00:18,"I'm good, I'm good, Right.",prospect
8,00:20,"So Sudharth, before we start, have you taken any mocks yet?",agent
8,00:26,", just just wanted to check.",agent
8,00:28,"Yeah, I've taken one of the mock.",prospect
8,00:30,"So diagnostic, diagnostic test of the mv.com that the first mock that we get.",prospect
8,00:34,"No, yeah, yeah, yeah.",agent
8,00:37,"So that I have taken OK, you you have taken that.",agent
8,00:41,And how was your score?,agent
8,00:43,It was 425 something 425 is it?,prospect
8,00:48,"Yeah, correct.",prospect
8,00:49,"OK, OK.",agent
8,00:50,So what's your target score?,agent
8,00:52,"And you know what, what is it that you're planning in terms of?",agent
8,00:58,Yeah.,prospect
8,00:59,OK.,prospect
8,00:59,"So firstly I'm, I'm just started to think about doing MBA firstly.",prospect
8,01:05,"And the main reason that I choosing GMAT over CAT is that I'm already, I'm already having a good amount of like I'm getting a good salary.",prospect
8,01:14,What if I'm working so far?,prospect
8,01:16,"So it doesn't make any sense to do MVA from India because I, I will have a yeah, average package of that much only.",prospect
8,01:22,So that's why.,prospect
8,01:24,So that's the reason.,prospect
8,01:26,And and I started the GMAT I have I'm like I'm I got I went to all the resources and all GMAT club and such all things.,prospect
8,01:33,"I am kind of confused right now first thing is that like, you know, am I too late for the applying for the GMAT or something like that?",prospect
8,01:40,I have a work experience of around 2.5 years 2.5 right.,prospect
8,01:45,How how it will be late like in terms of see the round one application for anyways this year application is mostly close.,agent
8,01:53,"So correct, correct.",prospect
8,01:54,Yeah.,prospect
8,01:55,"So you you starting at a 425, it's not that sensible to look for one month or 2 month program.",agent
8,02:01,"So yeah, it have to have your time.",agent
8,02:03,And what you have thought about like June to September.,agent
8,02:07,So September would be the deadline for most of the school.,agent
8,02:10,So a score in the month of July would help.,agent
8,02:14,"June, July at least in the starting of July or end of June is something which you can look for taking the test.",agent
8,02:20,So whether with the 6 months of prep is what you need to look at.,agent
8,02:24,"And you should be looking if you are looking outside India, you should be looking for a score of you know 6957 not 5 plus see you know you would see in most of the schools written 71072730.",agent
8,02:37,So those are classic edition.,agent
8,02:40,So we had classic edition first and now it's focus edition.,agent
8,02:43,So the test has changed.,agent
8,02:45,So the people have taken classic edition in 2020 their their course is still valid till 2025.,agent
8,02:51,They can apply the schools with that score itself.,agent
8,02:53,"So that's why most of the schools have, you know, this aspect covered or you know, the the scores which they mentioned the website to is to include them as well.",agent
8,03:05,"So they have not changed it maybe from 2026 you will see the focus edition specific target schools, target scores for this schools.",agent
8,03:13,"So yeah, if you are looking at the top schools like in CR Paris, say Howard, Stanford, if you are looking for the top schools, that median is at 6:00, 85 kind of score.",agent
8,03:22,So you should be looking at 30 point on top of that.,agent
8,03:24,"So it will not be the median range, it will be, you know, I arranged a 77 and 5 could be a good score to chase.",agent
8,03:32,"You know, in terms of your prep together 7 and 5 you have to have a total sum of.",agent
8,03:39,I hope you are aware of GMAT structure.,agent
8,03:42,Are you?,prospect
8,03:42,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,03:43,I have gone through all the structure and all.,prospect
8,03:45,So I am pretty much aware about the GMAT Focus edition and how it is different from the classic edition.,prospect
8,03:50,"So I am pretty good aware of that, yeah.",prospect
8,03:52,Yeah.,agent
8,03:52,"So the scale score start from 60 to 90, V 60 to V 90, D 60 to D 90 and Q 60 to Q 90.",agent
8,04:01,And what you need to get as 715 is the sum of score of 256 is what you need to get as 715.,agent
8,04:09,"So irrespective of which combination you look at, you have to get a, you know 2256 that that's what you are going to cheat.",agent
8,04:18,"Yeah, OK.",agent
8,04:18,"So that being said, So what we are going to look at is or maybe in this call itself, I will create a plan and show it to you so that you would understand how many hours on verbal content.",agent
8,04:29,"Yeah, you're gonna put.",agent
8,04:31,"But apart from that, you know, just wanted to ask how did you hear about us?",agent
8,04:36,"Sorry, Easy.",agent
8,04:36,And what how did you hear about easy?,agent
8,04:38,"I I went to the YouTube modus, most of the channels.",prospect
8,04:42,"So yeah, that's all I went to.",prospect
8,04:44,"OK, OK, OK, OK.",agent
8,04:46,"Yeah, yeah.",agent
8,04:47,So generally we get a lot of students coming through our own existing students.,agent
8,04:51,So that's what I was just checking if that's the case.,agent
8,04:53,"OK, All right, so that's OK.",agent
8,04:56,So what are the things that I would like to understand in this call so that we can accordingly discuss?,agent
8,05:01,"OK, sure.",prospect
8,05:02,"So I'm kind of like kind of not sure, like, you know, because I was, I was going through videos and a lot of people like, you know, the starting point where something 525 or something and I'm almost way too low from 425.",prospect
8,05:16,"So that's the pretty much confusion that, you know, like am I way too low scoring that way?",prospect
8,05:22,"And apart from that, how this structure will be working because I will have a I will be working during this whole time and definitely I will be looking forward to do this.",prospect
8,05:31,Applying is for the September round.,prospect
8,05:33,So definitely I will be looking forward to around what?,prospect
8,05:36,"Yeah, June, July, I will be ready to give the test.",prospect
8,05:39,So that's what I'm targeting right now.,prospect
8,05:41,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,05:43,So do you have this course open right now?,agent
8,05:46,Can you just take the scores?,agent
8,05:48,OK.,prospect
8,05:48,Just 425.,prospect
8,05:50,"Yeah, just accordingly we will create a plan.",agent
8,05:52,"OK, sure, sure.",prospect
8,05:52,Just give me a minute.,prospect
8,05:53,I will just let you.,prospect
8,05:57,"Meanwhile, I am just sharing my screen.",agent
8,06:00,"Yeah, you can just dictate your scores to me.",agent
8,06:05,"Once you take it, let me know.",agent
8,06:06,OK.,prospect
8,06:07,Yeah.,prospect
8,06:12,"See it is all about irrespective of the starting point, what matters is how long it is going to take.",agent
8,06:18,"See irrespective of the scores that you get, what we are actually more keen on is to understand how long it is going to take because GMAT is a very has a very defined syllabus.",agent
8,06:28,So one of the key elements of GMAT is we have a very defined syllabus and you are going to get questions on it from those type of questions.,agent
8,06:34,The type of questions are also limited in terms of verbal content di.,agent
8,06:38,"So that is one of the reasons why you see most of the prep programs are limited to 6 months because if you are taking more than 6 months to 7 months for GMAT, that means that you are doing things wrong somewhere.",agent
8,06:51,"Maybe your study was not in the right direction, you had a lot of gaps in terms of your prep, maybe you have not studied everyday.",agent
8,06:57,So a lot of factors would account for it if if there is an extension beyond that.,agent
8,07:03,"So because you know when, when a very different topic is there, it is like, you know, just for example, your test in your, you know, bachelors, the OR, or in your school, you have a syllabus, you are going to finish it in one point of time or the other.",agent
8,07:16,"Even if you are someone who is at a really low score and you are in the failing category of out of 100, you are getting 10 in your test does not mean that you are never going to hit 100, right?",agent
8,07:27,"It is not, does not mean that you are never going to hit in IT.",agent
8,07:29,It is all about how you prepare yourself to get to that 90.,agent
8,07:32,You have to learn from the fundamentals.,agent
8,07:34,"You have to do a lot of fundamental study within our platform, which is so our course is also really comprehensive.",agent
8,07:39,So the difference between you and someone who is starting at the 535 years.,agent
8,07:43,I can also show you one of the confidence students studying at a 55 in 3 months go to a store of 715555 have gone to a 765 in around 4 months.,agent
8,07:54,In your case the 3 months from 425 to 7 15 May not be that realistic.,agent
8,08:00,But of course double the time you know 4 to around 5 to 6 months and one other aspect is to go from 425 to 555 like they are starting point you are going to get faster because the learning curve towards the initial you know the span of score improvement during the initial phase of score improvement is going to be easy.,agent
8,08:20,300 to 400 is easy then going from 400 to 500 correct.,agent
8,08:25,And so going from this 500 to 600 is difficult and then 600 to 700 is even difficult.,agent
8,08:32,From 700 to 800 is going to be even difficult.,agent
8,08:34,"So it is going to be exponential, not linear in terms of the efforts that you have to put.",agent
8,08:39,"So that being said, you are going to get to what what their starting point was in maybe around a month, months time, 100 point improvement.",agent
8,08:48,You can you are going to see in 30 to 40 days depending upon the number of hours you put in and then you are going to start from there.,agent
8,08:54,"So maybe you take a couple of months more, but that is what you would have to do.",agent
8,08:59,"So yeah, once you take your score, let me know I will create it.",agent
8,09:01,"Yeah, yeah, sure.",prospect
8,10:36,Hi.,prospect
8,12:48,Where have you taken the mock from this nba.com is it?,agent
8,12:52,"Yeah, mba.com now, OK, after that.",prospect
8,13:05,"Actually I after that giving that ma.com I just started, you know, with the basic preparation of, you know, just the formulas and how this works and all.",prospect
8,13:15,"So after that, I don't want to consume the second test.",prospect
8,13:19,"So that's why I gave the Yeah, you shouldn't you shouldn't see the results of mock is actually limited.",agent
8,13:25,"You cannot you know wasted its bit scarce to be precise to get the real you know adaptive mocks kind of thing it's actually going to be a bit difficult yeah, GMAT is GMAT is not loading.",agent
8,13:49,"So not sure why it is that's OK in your case, like the way I said, I could have just created even the same study plan you are going to create once you, you know, purchase, you know, once you take up the course, you are going to have this see, like can you just see my screen?",agent
8,14:06,"Yeah, I can see your screen.",prospect
8,14:09,"So you are going to have this getting started videos, the plan where you are going to actually understand how to create this study plan.",agent
8,14:15,"So in your case, I am pretty sure since you had this problem, that is why I thought I will help you with that or else I can just do you remember the scores at least on verbal content?",agent
8,14:24,"DI I will can I tell you about this test that I gave on Maghush in that actually yeah, you can, you can let me know.",prospect
8,14:33,"OK, So what is the score there?",agent
8,14:36,The score was 505 and for the quantitative it is 78.,prospect
8,14:44,So let's let's keep your target.,agent
8,14:46,So we will we will take that score right now.,agent
8,14:48,"So maybe later on you can create a plan later on with the existing or you know, once once you get in.",agent
8,14:56,So you can do that.,agent
8,14:57,"So it's 99 percentile, which is your target.",agent
8,14:59,"And yeah, score is 5, not 50505, correct, Correct.",agent
8,15:04,OK.,agent
8,15:04,"And it was, I'm just keeping it as india.com mock and verbal was how much Verbal was 7676, Quant, Swiss quant was 78, 78 and data insights it was 7171.",agent
8,15:28,"Meanwhile, before that, could you just share me the your share screen and just show it to me quickly?",agent
8,15:35,Is that possible?,agent
8,15:36,"Yeah, sure, sure.",prospect
8,15:42,My screen is visible.,prospect
8,15:45,"Yes, yes, it is visible.",agent
8,15:46,Yeah.,agent
8,15:48,"So lets take the most recent one, September one, yeah.",agent
8,15:54,So just see the results.,agent
8,15:56,"Yeah, can just click see result detail.",agent
8,15:59,"Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.",prospect
8,16:10,Yeah.,prospect
8,16:11,"So lets take quant, lets quickly go down.",agent
8,16:15,Lets lets see.,agent
8,16:23,Yeah.,prospect
8,16:24,OK.,agent
8,16:24,"Still can you get it a bit lower, just question wise, is there this one?",agent
8,16:32,"OK, so hard question you got wrong with AC OK, OK, just one second, a bit slow.",agent
8,16:43,Just wanted to see.,agent
8,16:44,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,16:59,See one of the troubles with this and the inconsistency in the markers because just tell you a scenario.,agent
8,17:06,"Yeah, we started with a hard question.",agent
8,17:09,"As soon as the first question was wrong, directly switched to EC, not medium and then medium, EC, medium, the second and 3rd was fine and you got right and then went to hard and then again hard got wrong.",agent
8,17:21,"Medium, that is fine.",agent
8,17:22,Medium got right and you got to hard.,agent
8,17:25,"Hard got wrong again, you got hard.",agent
8,17:27,"That is OK, inconsistent with the above pattern but still it is fine.",agent
8,17:31,Then hard got right.,agent
8,17:32,Then you saw medium.,agent
8,17:34,"OK, so, so it is not that you know so, so we will see.",agent
8,17:39,The medium also got right.,agent
8,17:40,"Then you got again hard, hard got wrong, medium hard and medium got wrong again.",agent
8,17:45,You got hard question and hard question.,agent
8,17:48,That hard question you got right.,agent
8,17:49,Then the medium question.,agent
8,17:50,"So what I wanted to show you was it is a mixed bag of questions with for the sake of it, it is adaptive, but it is not the actual adaptive and the focus edition you are going to get a mixed bag of questions.",agent
8,18:02,"The first couple of questions would be, you know, would would determine next set of questions and then the next set of questions.",agent
8,18:08,So that's how it's going to be.,agent
8,18:09,"So yeah, so a bit differentiating isn't it?",agent
8,18:15,"So where you see there are some inconsistency, that's why the score may be a deviation, but still it's fine.",agent
8,18:22,"Anyways, if solved there will not be much difference.",agent
8,18:25,But still just wanted to show you know how generally I see this with the mocks.,agent
8,18:31,That's why I just wanted to see if that's the case here also.,agent
8,18:35,"So, so here in the hard questions you got right in the 11th question, once you get right again, the next question was medium.",agent
8,18:43,"Yeah, so yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,18:48,"Alright, so that's OK, we will get back.",agent
8,18:54,"So I will, I will just share my screen.",agent
8,18:58,Sure yeah.,prospect
8,19:02,Even the experts global mock you know it is all they will give you 1012 mocks but not adaptive at all.,agent
8,19:08,So it should be a bit mindful of the mocks and purchase it should see the major trouble with the mocks.,agent
8,19:16,If it is not right is because you would eventually build a plan or a strategy assuming that is a scenario which is not and then you create a plan or you know a strategy for it and which would be a counterproductive.,agent
8,19:29,Generally students would say that I got an mocks this is score and when I went there I got this score.,agent
8,19:34,One of the reasons there are couple of reasons.,agent
8,19:36,The first thing is your average accuracy across each other subscriptions might not be determined.,agent
8,19:41,So you would not have known.,agent
8,19:42,"Suppose if you take critical reasoning, in critical reasoning you have 9 types of questions assumption, evaluate, strengthen.",agent
8,19:48,"We can bold face, miscellaneous we will have like fill in the blanks which is logically completes flop paradox.",agent
8,19:54,So you will have around 9 types of questions and these are the only time type of questions that can come.,agent
8,19:58,So you have to particularly identify and ensure that you are getting.,agent
8,20:01,"To get a 90th percentile you have to have a, you know 90th percentile in 95th percentile in verbal.",agent
8,20:08,So in your case in verbal is 97th percentile that we need to chase.,agent
8,20:11,So when we hit target this 97 percentile you have to hit around 92 to 93 percentile in CRN itself.,agent
8,20:17,And similarly for RC to get A902903 percentile in CR you have to have an 80% hard accuracy.,agent
8,20:23,Hard accuracy is every 10 questions you hard questions you solve you have to get 8 questions right.,agent
8,20:27,To get that accuracy you have to understand for each type of question the 9 type of question within CR what is your accuracy in independently each type of question.,agent
8,20:35,Most of them should not be aware of it.,agent
8,20:36,"What they do is they would solve then they there is a possibility that you know, say out of 95 topics they are meeting those target percentages remaining.",agent
8,20:44,"They are not meeting the test said hypothetically, if question pool increases or the question pool is more proportionately higher from the area of their non high areas where you they are just at 60%, 60 percentage accuracy.",agent
8,20:59,"If the question pool is more from there, there eventually the their accuracy is going to dip and of course, consequently their percentiles and consequently their verbal scores.",agent
8,21:08,So that's why you would see a deviation in the scores in the marks that they take or in the in actual test wherever this deviation comes to course or this inconsistency which we need to address.,agent
8,21:17,"And most of the students when we encounter them, they would clearly tell them that they are not even aware that OK, in this 9th section what they are accuracy, they are not thought about it.",agent
8,21:25,So that's one of the aspects which creates a differentiator.,agent
8,21:29,"The next thing is with the mock, maybe the mock would not be adaptive and they would build a strategy and then we go to the test and then realise that, OK, you know, whatever I have prepared for this not working because that's not the scenario which you wear it.",agent
8,21:42,So our mocks is pretty accurate.,agent
8,21:44,It's plus or -10 so to the to the action test.,agent
8,21:47,So we have done a lot of R&D with that.,agent
8,21:50,"So, yeah, so you should make sure I am not telling that it is just us who has cracked it, but you know you just have to go to the scores and see if it makes sense.",agent
8,22:01,"In this case, you saw it.",agent
8,22:02,"When you get 2 hard or hard questions, right next will not go to medium.",agent
8,22:08,It will be continuing with the hard set of questions.,agent
8,22:10,At least if 3 questions are there in that majority is taken into account.,agent
8,22:14,In that case it is different.,agent
8,22:15,"But yeah, so that sometimes does not make sense and that would be a clear indication for you that you do not make have to make.",agent
8,22:22,"Maybe you could take the test for solving questions, but not, you know, strategising with that.",agent
8,22:27,Yeah.,agent
8,22:29,All right.,agent
8,22:30,"Yeah, my net is a bit slow today.",agent
8,22:32,OK.,agent
8,22:33,So what's your CR&RC percentile in that?,agent
8,22:36,Any idea in verbal?,agent
8,22:40,"In verbal, just just a second.",agent
8,22:45,"So for it's not showing in that assumption, but mostly I am I am corrected with the.",agent
8,22:57,"So I am just putting the capping, just putting the capping for it.",agent
8,23:02,So getting bubble milestone and similarly I will create for corn just to have a fair idea and estimate into.,agent
8,23:11,And to be honest we are going to consider that you take more time because we are going to take that 425 to face value.,agent
8,23:19,We are going to take that.,agent
8,23:20,So it is loading a bit.,agent
8,23:22,"Yeah, so edit, load and similarly.",agent
8,23:54,"You know, verbal part, I've seen that critical reasoning part was like something that I have most of the time that both of the mocks that I've attempted, they were like, I have most of them I got correct.",prospect
8,24:06:00,"But with when you're talking about RC, it is super bad, like not at all.",prospect
8,24:11:00,Single.,prospect
8,24:11:00,"Yeah, that's what, yeah.",prospect
8,24:13:00,So we have to cover from the fundamentals.,agent
8,24:15:00,That's what the course would do.,agent
8,24:17:00,"So arithmetic, I'm just taking 60 and 40.",agent
8,24:20:00,Arithmetic being higher.,agent
8,24:22:00,Is that the case generally?,agent
8,24:24:00,"Yeah, Yeah, that is true.",prospect
8,24:28:00,OK and lets also take data insights.,agent
8,24:41:00,"Once your network is fine, it's gonna navigate like butter.",agent
8,24:45:00,But yeah.,agent
8,24:45:00,So in my case I guess it's a bit so that's why I am off Cam.,agent
8,24:50:00,So the previous call it was a bit stuck.,agent
8,24:53:00,"So that's why I went off Cam for OK, better clarity.",agent
8,24:59:00,So within DS data insights and just taking some random scores just for the sake of it.,agent
8,25:08:00,"And yeah, So what is going to happen is based on the scores that you have, you have you do to get a clear idea in terms of how many hours that you have to study and you know, how many hours you have to put for your verbal quant and DA prep as a whole.",agent
8,25:22:00,"In your case, what should be the average for you think on a working day?",agent
8,25:26:00,"And we, they, we can, you know, what do you think could be your time availability in terms of your breath?",agent
8,25:35:00,What do you think?,prospect
8,25:36:00,2 hours?,prospect
8,25:37:00,I think it's definitely 2.5 hours.,prospect
8,25:39:00,I can definitely give because my timing will be like 9 to 7.,prospect
8,25:44:00,"So after that, OK, 2 hours after skipping, let's, let's forget about the 52.5, let's skip 2 to be on safer side.",agent
8,25:50:00,What about weekends?,agent
8,25:52:00,Weekends I am totally free.,prospect
8,25:53:00,So we can arrange it as per whatever time which is fine.,prospect
8,25:58:00,So 5 years or 6 hours.,agent
8,25:59:00,What do you think on an average 5 years we will keep just be on safe aside again.,agent
8,26:04:00,And let us assume you start from say tomorrow and let us take a tentative GMAT test it.,agent
8,26:09:00,It will be 11th of May that you should be ready with if provided this is the score.,agent
8,26:13:00,But in your case of course a 20 days extra might might you might take because if you take 425 it would have been a bit different.,agent
8,26:20:00,You would have gone you know maybe towards the starting of June you should be ready.,agent
8,26:26:00,"So, so around 5 to 6 months is what I also estimated.",agent
8,26:30:00,"So because that is what I have seen with students the, the achieving arts for it.",agent
8,26:34:00,"So that is what I also estimated that you would be doing that in terms of number of hours you have to give for your Rep, I will just, you are going to have a calendar view where you are going to have their understanding of what exactly has to be done.",agent
8,26:47:00,You would have a dedicated mentor in this program.,agent
8,26:49:00,So I have sent you one video.,agent
8,26:51:00,Could you?,agent
8,26:52:00,"So can you just go, maybe you can go on a mute.",agent
8,26:55:00,It is very important that's why I recommended that I have shared it you in WhatsApp video of of the mentor support.,agent
8,27:03:00,So just watch it and lets come back maybe after 10 its its a 7 minute video should be taking you more time.,agent
8,27:09:00,Can you just watch it and join back?,agent
8,27:11:00,I will be in this call.,agent
8,27:12:00,Only you can let me know once you watch it.,agent
8,27:15:00,Sure.,prospect
8,27:15:00,Yeah.,prospect
8,27:15:00,Please.,prospect
8,27:15:00,Please send.,prospect
8,27:16:00,Yeah.,prospect
8,33:48:00,"Yeah, I went through the video.",prospect
8,33:52:00,Yeah.,agent
8,33:52:00,So that's that's regarding the mentor support that you're going to get along with the program.,agent
8,33:57:00,So it's not something which you're going to be charged.,agent
8,34:00:00,That's something which you're going to have by default along with the course.,agent
8,34:03:00,"So that's how you saw how the, you know, resolution if you have any topics doubt or something where you want your, you know, subject expert to create a video for you and all these things.",agent
8,34:13:00,"So all these options are there in terms of your preparation within the portal itself, you are going to have this learning modules like the way it is, it was reflecting there within verbal.",agent
8,34:21:00,"If you see in your case, you are going to start with master comprehension, you know, do you know what creates the difference between what reading competition versus struggle, right.",agent
8,34:30:00,"So generally asking, do you know what is the difference between a hard passage and an easy passage?",agent
8,34:35:00,What do you think would be the major difference somewhere down the line?,agent
8,34:39:00,I feel like understanding the passage deep down so that the questions will be placed as per that because what I have seen it is not direct question.,prospect
8,34:48:00,"As soon as you move towards the hearts passage, you really have to understand that passage deeply understand and then you will be able to answer that particular question.",prospect
8,34:57:00,So that is I have observed so far.,prospect
8,35:00:00,OK so that is one of the byproduct to be precise.,agent
8,35:04:00,So the major key factor which makes a passage and excel this for everyone.,agent
8,35:09:00,I will see in your case you have let talking about your perspective but in general perspective what we see is what makes the passage difficult and easy is the structuring of sentences.,agent
8,35:18:00,For every hard passage you would see that the passage would be comprising of a lot of long sentences like 25 to 30 words.,agent
8,35:25:00,And So what happens is see all all this long sentences are also found using a chain of thoughts by an author.,agent
8,35:34:00,So this chain of thoughts are formed the forms into short sentences which is interlinked to form a long sentence.,agent
8,35:43:00,So this long sentences are responsible for you to have or or spend a lot of your time rereading things.,agent
8,35:51:00,"You would eventually eat up a lot of time which subsequently going to affect your remaining performance in your section because one section if you are if you are sitting and doing or particular set of questions, you know generally you would have seen that you are solving it.",agent
8,36:04:00,"You are taking 6 to 7 minutes to solve the first question, then again the remaining questions you are going to come back to that particular passage once again to answer those questions and that is again taking you a couple of minutes.",agent
8,36:13:00,So technically in CR also you will eat up a lot of time for your CR as Welland then you eventually come down from that hard category to medium category to is category.,agent
8,36:22:00,That is how it it moves and that is something which is responsible for your low score.,agent
8,36:26:00,So we have to cover from the fundamentals.,agent
8,36:29:00,So someone who is already at a 70th percentile or 80th percentile will recommend them to skip this because they would also already be thorough with it.,agent
8,36:36:00,They are reading competition.,agent
8,36:37:00,"It is on point and at 8080 percentage accuracy, we generally recommend them not to take it.",agent
8,36:43:00,"In your case, you have to take it because you are going to have some learnings from here in terms of how to make your reading more effective.",agent
8,36:48:00,So we are going to learn how this long and complicated sentences have formed in the first place.,agent
8,36:52:00,"And once you learn the art of how this long sentences are formed, then you are going to learn how to deconstruct it as single read.",agent
8,36:58:00,"And then we will have this pause points which is there which is actually going to help you understand where the pause strategically for efficient note taking and in the least possible words, how to identify what is important and what is not in a passage.",agent
8,37:10:00,And then take notes and how to use these notes to solve your 3 or 4 questions that follows a passage and not the not the passage in itself.,agent
8,37:18:00,"So these are the strategies which the people who are at the top, you know, scorers of 90th percentile, 95th percentile plus and global do.",agent
8,37:27:00,"So what you are going to do is replicate that because the technique is very you know, efficiently a proven especially the verbal section and all has been there since ages.",agent
8,37:36:00,So the the standard technique to improve in your reading competition is already there.,agent
8,37:41:00,What we need to do is understand how to do it and learn technique to how to how to execute it.,agent
8,37:46:00,"And then you are also going to have some skill building exercises where you are going to learn, you know, inferring meaning, then quantifiers, comparisons, then all all this understanding references all this in 7 and cover.",agent
8,38:00:00,So this is actually going to take you around 7 and a half hours of your time.,agent
8,38:04:00,"So this would in your case would take 3 to 4 working days or maybe a you know, one and a half days in a weekend is going to going to take for master compensation.",agent
8,38:14:00,"Once master compensation is done, then you go for critical racing.",agent
8,38:17:00,So within critical racing again we start with the foundational concept.,agent
8,38:21:00,Every CR question has a structure right?,agent
8,38:22:00,"One paragraph followed by a question, same followed by 5 options.",agent
8,38:25:00,That is a standard structure that is ever going to come in your CR.,agent
8,38:28:00,There is no other structure for CR apart from this.,agent
8,38:31:00,So what are what are those paragraph comprising of?,agent
8,38:33:00,"Every CR question comprise of the same phenomenon, premise and conclusion.",agent
8,38:37:00,So that is what the paragraph is made of.,agent
8,38:38:00,Every every CR question we are going to learn more about that.,agent
8,38:42:00,"So we have 4 files learning models for that and each would be followed up with this, you know quizzes towards the end to assess how much you have learned from it.",agent
8,38:50:00,And also you are going to have a journey view.,agent
8,38:52:00,Within journey view you are going to see yourself getting compared.,agent
8,38:55:00,Now you you compare your performance with the median global population in terms of their first starting scores or first starting scores for each of the file.,agent
8,39:02:00,"If you are getting grade A, that's indicator that you are doing really Welland if you are getting grade with that means that you are doing at par, you need improvement.",agent
8,39:08:00,So you are going to have some pop ups in terms and reviews that you are going to do.,agent
8,39:12:00,"And if you are getting rate C, that means that you have to redo the complete file once more.",agent
8,39:16:00,"If this file you are getting a grade C, you are going to redo this complete file once more.",agent
8,39:21:00,So that is that is the indicator.,agent
8,39:23:00,And there is also another significance of this grading.,agent
8,39:25:00,"If you are consistently getting an overall, if you see the learning also starts from level zero to Level 3.",agent
8,39:30:00,"So what happens is we are like, you know, I assume that you would have played games, you know earlier.",agent
8,39:36:00,"So you would see that the boss fight always comes to the end, right?",agent
8,39:38:00,"So you that happens because initially when you start, you have to understand the mechanics.",agent
8,39:44:00,"You have to understand the basic things and then upgrade yourself in terms of your here, in terms of your understanding there, in terms of your tools or techniques or unlocking powers.",agent
8,39:54:00,"So here what happens is you want to unlock those techniques, unlock the, you know, those learnings from yourself at each level, which is.",agent
8,40:01:00,"So initially if you are getting say grade C here and grade C here, it will be very surprising to get a grade A here because your quality of learning was poised.",agent
8,40:11:00,So your focus is.,agent
8,40:13:00,"It will be very easy for you to get a grade A here and if you get a grade A here, A here, you are going to have an easy task in getting a grade A here and then it is going to be an easy task to get grade A here and then it will be going to easy task to get a grade A here.",agent
8,40:26:00,So it is going to be progressive.,agent
8,40:27:00,So you cannot.,agent
8,40:28:00,"So the another significance is initially when you start your prep say suppose you are at 33rd percentile, you have to go to 94th percentile.",agent
8,40:35:00,"It does not happen overnight, right?",agent
8,40:37:00,It does not happen that you studied for 6 months and the 6 month and day one after that you are going to magically switch to 94.,agent
8,40:44:00,"Your progress is going to be very you know it is going to happen throughout your journey, right?",agent
8,40:50:00,"So you are going to see that your progress you are progressing from that 33rd to 50th percentile, then 70th percentile, then 84th percentile, then 94th percentile.",agent
8,40:59:00,So you will have a lot of milestones where you would be you know crossing those and then you would have that feedback also.,agent
8,41:05:00,What if you spend the whole duration then you realise that it has does not help.,agent
8,41:10:00,"It is not the time commitment that you are giving, you are also giving your, you know it is not about the money, it is also about the time commitment that you are giving here.",agent
8,41:17:00,So which cannot be taken back and you have to apply for round one.,agent
8,41:21:00,So once you realise it by June it will be too late.,agent
8,41:24:00,You cannot do anything at that point of time.,agent
8,41:26:00,So we do not want that to happen.,agent
8,41:27:00,You have to have a clear indication of when you are improving and if you are not improving there is a reason.,agent
8,41:32:00,So that is why you have a mentor to understand how it works and they they are going to keep track of it and going to give you constant feedbacks in terms of your prep.,agent
8,41:40:00,"So, so it will be a task basic approach.",agent
8,41:42:00,"So if you are purchasing the course today, you would get a mentor assigned by tomorrow.",agent
8,41:45:00,And So what what would happen is they are going to give you the first set of task to do.,agent
8,41:50:00,"You are going to finish it there, then they are going to evaluate it, they are going to give you feedbacks and then you are going to go to the next task.",agent
8,41:54:00,So it will be task based approach that you are going to proceed.,agent
8,41:58:00,"And of course it is it is guided by your, this is a framework.",agent
8,42:01:00,"If you are aware of the concept of framework in a, you know IT, we have this framework, right.",agent
8,42:05:00,"So this is a framework, but we build your plan on top of that, on top of the framework to if you related to your needs.",agent
8,42:12:00,So that is that is how it is going to be.,agent
8,42:14:00,"And like the way I said, once we cover this, you know, foundation concepts and each other files.",agent
8,42:22:00,"If you look at each other module, one of the each module is a different type of question.",agent
8,42:26:00,The first part initially you would start with concept files.,agent
8,42:28:00,"So you learn the concepts and the techniques, the DIP centric and all these things would be covered here.",agent
8,42:33:00,And then we go for the application files where whatever you have learned is not natural to you.,agent
8,42:37:00,You have to make it a muscle memory.,agent
8,42:39:00,You have to make sure that that comes as a default technique for you.,agent
8,42:42:00,So that we have application files where the objective is only to get the right answer with your given technique in respect of the time that you take.,agent
8,42:48:00,Then inference practice file with the time space you have to get the right answer is in the given technique.,agent
8,42:53:00,"Similarly, each type of question, once you cover each type of questions, you would be navigating through your complete levels like level zero, level one.",agent
8,43:00:00,So the course in itself is designed to have tougher topics towards the end of the learning modules.,agent
8,43:05:00,"So yeah, you will, you will cover Level 3 and then what you do is you are going to go to stage 2.",agent
8,43:10:00,Your stage one is done when you go to stage 2.,agent
8,43:12:00,"So within stage 2, let me I think I have already opened it.",agent
8,43:16:00,"In stage 2, you are going to take subsection marks.",agent
8,43:18:00,"You have completed CR, but when you complete CR, you are 33rd percentile based on your quality of learning, you would be in a spectrum.",agent
8,43:26:00,"So here in this case, you are consistently at a grade A throughout.",agent
8,43:29:00,So you would be in a spectrum between 45 percentile to 45th percentile to a 70th percentile.,agent
8,43:36:00,That will be the spectrum in stage one.,agent
8,43:38:00,So you are currently at 33 from 33.,agent
8,43:40:00,"Maybe if your quality of learning is really poor in that case, like you have BCBB kind of grade or BBCC kind of grade.",agent
8,43:48:00,In that case.,agent
8,43:49:00,"In that scenario, you would be at the lower end of the spectrum, like you would be at a 45th, 15th percentile.",agent
8,43:53:00,"But if your quality of learning is good and you are at grade A, So what you would be at a 70th percentile.",agent
8,43:58:00,"So even if you are at 70th percentile you are not at 20:00, 4th percentile age.",agent
8,44:02:00,So to get a 94th percentile you have to have an accuracy of hard accuracy of 80 percentage that should be a threshold.,agent
8,44:07:00,In this case the threshold is kept as just one second.,agent
8,44:11:00,In this case the threshold is kept as 70 percentage for this student which have copy pasted.,agent
8,44:16:00,So in your case will be 80 percentage.,agent
8,44:19:00,Initially you would be below that is OK.,agent
8,44:21:00,You are going to have a clear idea.,agent
8,44:22:00,"So this part you have already seen in the video like with NCR within top level, you are going to see what is your accuracy, what is your average correct time, incorrect time based on which you will be doing the course correction and wherever it is required.",agent
8,44:34:00,"If your mentor is asking you to go back to the course because we capture a lot of data here, we are going to clearly pinpoint what exactly are the cost of inference is your cause of trouble, what is the complete stage one, your mentor is exactly going to tell you the files which maybe you have faltered, maybe you can do better.",agent
8,44:49:00,They would ask you to take those files where you are going to take it and make sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.,agent
8,44:54:00,Then actually you can come back and create custom quizzes.,agent
8,44:57:00,Within custom quizzes you can actually you know just select those particular files and ensure that you are going to make sure that you are going to practice those questions.,agent
8,45:06:00,"If it is inferential or you have went back, you made sure that the conceptual gaps are filled.",agent
8,45:10:00,Now it is your focus on inference to make it cross 80 percentage accuracy.,agent
8,45:15:00,So you are going to take inference in custom quizzes and ensure that it is crossing.,agent
8,45:18:00,"So independently if 3 or 4 weaknesses, they are going to identify independently and make sure that those weakness are dealt with.",agent
8,45:25:00,"So when you when you isolate your weakness and improve on your weakness, initially your score was being pulled down because of that weakness.",agent
8,45:31:00,Once that weakness in itself is about saved your 80 percentage threshold which is which would be yours.,agent
8,45:36:00,You want to say that now you are going above the threshold and that is an indicator that you are ready for the next game.,agent
8,45:41:00,So you are in a different next session.,agent
8,45:43:00,The same happens for reading competition and other sections in quantity as well.,agent
8,45:46:00,In quants we have something better like we have something called pace.,agent
8,45:52:00,"So even when you start from quans, quans is an area which is highly concept like.",agent
8,45:58:00,"It is high on concepts like unlike verbal and data insights, you would have very minimal concepts to learn.",agent
8,46:04:00,But in in quans is an area which have lot of concepts and eventually it is going to take really lot of time to complete the conception.,agent
8,46:11:00,So we understand that even when you start maybe you are not that strong but it is not that you do not know anything at all.,agent
8,46:19:00,Maybe in the worst case you still know 20% of it 80% you don't know we can accept that.,agent
8,46:24:00,So.,agent
8,46:25:00,"So what we need is at least for the 20% that you have or in some cases you would already know 60 percentage, just 40 percentage you have to learn.",agent
8,46:33:00,So we don't want you to waste your time in things which you already know.,agent
8,46:36:00,So for that we have something called PACE which is personalised adaptive course engine.,agent
8,46:40:00,So what it does is it actually evaluates by you know you are you are understanding you by now you know that each of the modulus type of question.,agent
8,46:47:00,So you for for those type of questions you are going to have a diagnostic quiz.,agent
8,46:53:00,Within that there will be multiple concepts and all the things which will be covered based on how you perform in the quiz.,agent
8,46:58:00,"Your average correct time, incorrect time, other pressure, you know the other other pressure graph plots and all this things that we capture and also your activity.",agent
8,47:06:00,You are going to recommend only those particular topics where you need to spend your time and going to recommend you to skip the topics which you are already thorough with.,agent
8,47:14:00,Here you see 90 to 2 percentage and only 2 files like exponents.,agent
8,47:18:00,You are recommended other areas you can skip by.,agent
8,47:20:00,So this would give you a guarantee that you don't.,agent
8,47:22:00,You don't have to have the fear of missing out.,agent
8,47:24:00,Sometimes what happens is see we know that we know it.,agent
8,47:27:00,"Suppose if you look at say number classification, we know we are aware of number classification but what would eventually happen is we fear of skipping it because we will think OK what if I miss out on something critical.",agent
8,47:38:00,So you don't have to have that guilt here.,agent
8,47:40:00,"You are not missing out on anything critical or anything important that would you know, help you improve your score.",agent
8,47:46:00,You are not missing out on anything.,agent
8,47:47:00,That is why it is really accurate as well.,agent
8,47:50:00,Here you saw 100 percentage and nothing was recommended to skip again.,agent
8,47:53:00,But in fractions you saw 100 percentage.,agent
8,47:54:00,"And then still it is recommending you to take 2 photo of the files because even though you got 100 percentage, maybe your technique of solving in terms of the time taken or other other aspects, maybe these are the 2 files where you can improve your technique after you watch.",agent
8,48:08:00,"So wherever we have the slightest of the doubt that this area may not be as strong hold for you, you are going to recommend you to take it.",agent
8,48:14:00,So eventually you are going to save time for the topics which are already through it and wanna you know.,agent
8,48:20:00,So here even though got 100% 4 files are recommended.,agent
8,48:24:00,So there there are only 2 files are recommended.,agent
8,48:26:00,So here 4 files are recommended depends on the scenario.,agent
8,48:28:00,Here also again 100 percentage and here again 100 percentage 2 files are recommended.,agent
8,48:33:00,"So depending upon that scenario based thing, if you look at say if I take number properties within number properties, yeah, you got 170 percentage, some of the files recommended, some of the files are skipped.",agent
8,48:49:00,"You can see that here, right?",agent
8,48:50:00,So in in this case all the files were recommended for you to take because you have to learn from here.,agent
8,48:55:00,There is something you cannot skip anything at all.,agent
8,48:58:00,"And then divisible to reminders again, everything was recommended.",agent
8,49:01:00,"You have to take everything and wherever you are strong at here, based on which you got some recommended to skip some you have to take.",agent
8,49:07:00,"So this is actually, so this is like a fingerprint.",agent
8,49:11:00,Your case may not be the same like you have a twin brother with the same capability with the same score and same sectionals also.,agent
8,49:18:00,"Then also when you come here, maybe this pattern to this deep, it will be different for each of you in terms of the number of hours that you put in a number of studies.",agent
8,49:27:00,So that is how it makes a highly customizable and highly personalised study approach.,agent
8,49:33:00,"And you cannot, you can never expect this in a life class or in terms of a bats kind of class.",agent
8,49:39:00,It's not gonna happen because nobody is gonna give you that data or have have this focus.,agent
8,49:43:00,So that's something which you're gonna have with this program.,agent
8,49:47:00,So yeah.,agent
8,49:48:00,"OK, now let's let's address your doubts as well.",agent
8,49:51:00,"So if you have something, you can discuss that also.",agent
8,49:54:00,Yep.,agent
8,49:55:00,"So I think I'm pretty clear about this, how this dashboard is going to work and how this course curriculum is going to work that as I'm pretty sure of.",prospect
8,50:04:00,"So yeah, Yep.",prospect
8,50:06:00,And I would is there is there any possible can I go some through demo classes or something like that?,prospect
8,50:12:00,Is it available on Gmail?,prospect
8,50:14:00,"See, we have free trial.",agent
8,50:16:00,Have you seen the free trial?,agent
8,50:18:00,"No, I have not gone through it.",prospect
8,50:20:00,So you can just share your screen right now and I will help you.,agent
8,50:25:00,I'll direct it to you.,agent
8,50:26:00,"So the free trial, the, you know, approach is I'm I'm aware of that, like how on the GMAT on the e GMAT platform, how that we're going to access that free trial.",prospect
8,50:35:00,I'm aware of I'm not applying right now because I have I have to be out of India for like one week ahead.,prospect
8,50:42:00,So that's why I'm not using our free trial is unlimited.,agent
8,50:45:00,You don't have to subscribe to it or you don't have to give your card.,agent
8,50:48:00,So it's for infinite period of time.,agent
8,50:50:00,"So the free trial that is seen in our platform, yes.",agent
8,50:54:00,"So if you can take, I will just show you, if not, I will just tell you verbally.",agent
8,50:58:00,Yeah.,agent
8,50:58:00,So what what you are going to have is not a systematic learning there.,agent
8,51:02:00,"You cannot expect from the fundamentals like the way we discussed right learning level 0123, maybe here you are going to directly fight the middle boss.",agent
8,51:10:00,So you should not be decided by the difficulty of the topic but rather focus on how they teach.,agent
8,51:16:00,Are you comfortable with that teaching approach?,agent
8,51:19:00,"So that is what your whole idea should be, not to worry about if I am doing well in it or not.",agent
8,51:24:00,You don't have to bother about it at this point of time.,agent
8,51:27:00,Yeah.,agent
8,51:28:00,So that's what happened for about randomly taken the teaching pattern.,prospect
8,51:32:00,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,51:34:00,So we have a randomly taken sample from verbal quantum DI just for you to understand how we teach.,agent
8,51:41:00,"Yeah, yeah.",agent
8,51:44:00,So if you can just take I will help you with it so that you would get a clear idea of how to take the free trial.,agent
8,51:49:00,And in terms of within verbal within points.,agent
8,51:52:00,I will tell you about the diagnostic quiz.,agent
8,51:55:00,One of the students actually took the diagnostic question just thinking don't we have a lesson?,agent
8,51:59:00,It is just a test because the first 2 are diagnostic quiz which the students saw.,agent
8,52:03:00,"OK, so can you just log into it?",agent
8,52:08:00,Can you just sign in with your same Google Google?,agent
8,53:01:00,Maybe you can plug in your device maybe because of the power?,agent
8,53:04:00,Ohh sorry I didn't get it.,prospect
8,53:12:00,"Maybe you can plug in your device, maybe because of the low power the bandwidth.",agent
8,53:57:00,You can close it for the time being.,agent
8,54:03:00,You just select with select.,agent
8,54:04:00,You know just just select verbal or something quanter bubble or something just click it.,agent
8,54:14:00,So here in critical reasoning you don't have to open it.,agent
8,54:18:00,I am just I will help you navigate to it.,agent
8,54:21:00,Maybe you can press Start learning.,agent
8,54:22:00,Just click on Start learning there.,agent
8,54:27:00,"So on this one, so in introduction itself, we just Scroll down in that right page.",agent
8,54:34:00,Just Scroll down.,agent
8,54:35:00,"You're gonna have videos, you know, here.",agent
8,54:38:00,"So yeah, got it.",prospect
8,54:44:00,So so these are the scroll so so so you can see it will be in different ways in different space.,agent
8,54:51:00,"It will be so maybe for this you are going to have, you know, a page like this or else it will be a different set of page that you navigate through.",agent
8,54:59:00,"So depending upon the course, by course you are going to have a different structure.",agent
8,55:03:00,"So all, all, all we have is video lessons which should navigate through and try to understand.",agent
8,55:08:00,Are you able to grasp what is being communicated?,agent
8,55:10:00,"It is the language very clear to you is, is it just, is it communicating, you know, in synchronise with what you expect.",agent
8,55:18:00,So you can evaluate on those grounds and then take a call.,agent
8,55:22:00,Even for verbal quantities.,agent
8,55:23:00,Can you just go back?,agent
8,55:23:00,I will just quickly show you the quant as well that you know how you would have to take.,agent
8,55:38:00,"So within within no, no, do not go back.",agent
8,55:42:00,"No, you can just go forward.",agent
8,55:48:00,"OK, So within within number properties, you would first see this diagnostic quest which is there, right?",agent
8,55:55:00,You are going to take it and accordingly it is going to recommend you to skip some areas and going to ask you to take some areas.,agent
8,56:00:00,But maybe in this scenario you can avoid diagnostic quiz and directly take the concept because of course here we are not planning to.,agent
8,56:07:00,"So this is diagnostic issue you have selected, right?",agent
8,56:09:00,So we can you not take that you can directly start with concept because of course the point of skipping and all these things are there which you can actually do it in the actual platform.,agent
8,56:19:00,"This is not for saving your time, right?",agent
8,56:21:00,This is for you to understand.,agent
8,56:23:00,So you do not have to save your time here.,agent
8,56:25:00,So you can directly start with concepts and then you can so here you just have to press Start learning the top.,agent
8,56:38:00,"So just go down everywhere you are going to have videos like this where no, no, just just go up, go up.",agent
8,56:45:00,"You have to watch this video, then then go to the next files kind of things.",agent
8,56:49:00,And then so it will be tutors will be explaining things to you.,agent
8,56:53:00,"So once you finish it, you can go to the next and just go down.",agent
8,56:56:00,Then you will have one small test here understanding it's not if we are not going to capture any data from here just for you understanding.,agent
8,57:03:00,Then you go to the next file and towards then you are going to have a test as well.,agent
8,57:06:00,"So after takeaways you are going to go to the next like down you see Section 2, right Section 2 you are going to have for odd numbers you are going to click there.",agent
8,57:15:00,So next you are going to go to the odd numbers then the next the next.,agent
8,57:18:00,So you are going to navigate like that here again the video lessons.,agent
8,57:23:00,So you are going to watch it and then go to the next.,agent
8,57:25:00,So just check it out and let me know.,agent
8,57:28:00,"Yeah, sure, sure.",prospect
8,57:30:00,All right so when so you said you would be travelling this street.,agent
8,57:32:00,"So yeah, yeah maybe towards the mid of mid of Jan is what you are planning to start right?",agent
8,57:38:00,"Yeah, yeah.",prospect
8,57:39:00,And I just want to understand like what's the fee structure it is like for the like what's the plan and how it is?,prospect
8,57:45:00,See for see we have some discounts also running at the moment.,agent
8,57:49:00,"So see generally you try in a website $399 for 6 months and $299 for 4 months, which is around 34,000 for 6 months and 27,000 for 4 months.",agent
8,58:04:00,"Yeah, so that is there.",agent
8,58:06:00,"And since you would be travelling, suppose if you are able to take up free, some free talent depending upon even if you purchased say tomorrow or day after tomorrow does not mean that you have to start on the same day.",agent
8,58:18:00,"You can actually, actually start after you have visited and all these things you can start, the starting date can be resetted, but you should like to you know, get into that discount price.",agent
8,58:27:00,"It will be $319 for 6 months, which is 27,000 for.",agent
8,58:31:00,"So the price of 4 months you are going to get 6 months, 4 months is going to be for $249, which is 21,000.",agent
8,58:38:00,So that's what the difference which you saw when you pop up right discounts running.,agent
8,58:41:00,"So yeah, yeah, correct.",agent
8,58:42:00,Yeah.,agent
8,58:43:00,"So that was for 2 months, $159 which you saw in the portal.",agent
8,58:47:00,Yeah.,agent
8,58:47:00,"So 2 months, 4 months and 6 months, that's how the pricing goes.",agent
8,58:52:00,Let me know once you take the free while or just watch through it.,agent
8,58:55:00,"Let me know if you are comfortable with it and if you have already decided to take it in that case, you can, you know, we'll just discount and maybe start later as well.",agent
8,59:04:00,So it depends.,agent
8,59:05:00,Sure.,prospect
8,59:05:00,"Yeah, you can let me know whatever you're comfortable with.",prospect
8,59:08:00,"Definitely, definitely.",agent
8,59:10:00,"OK, All right, see you then.",agent
8,59:11:00,Yeah.,prospect
8,59:11:00,Thank you so much.,prospect
8,59:12:00,Bye.,agent
8,59:12:00,Bye.,agent
8,59:12:00,"Yeah, bye.",agent
8,59:14:00,Bye.,prospect
