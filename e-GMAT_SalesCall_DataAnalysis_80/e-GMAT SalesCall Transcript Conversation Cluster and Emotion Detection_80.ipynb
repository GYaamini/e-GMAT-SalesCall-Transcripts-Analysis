      "OK. OK. Yes, I mean I'm not sure if you are familiar with that if you are from India or I am from India, Subhanswar, OK, then you would be familiar with that. I would not take the suggestion or advice from your end. Correct, Correct. So yeah, if you're on sabbatical, it's not that, you know, then you will be able to put in more time on a daily basis compared to the folks who are in a full time job. So yes, we will work that out and I'm going to create a planner. So , before we start, I know that you're looking for an executive MBA. Your preferences are IIMA and IIMC. And did you say ISB as well? So these are the three colleges of your preference. , My one question would be is that how did you get to know about EG MAT? Great, great. So how did you do the analysis? Did you find us on Google? And who did you speak to? OK. Yeah. Have you heard of GMAT Club ? So if you go there. So GMAT Club is like a, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's a big forum for the GMAT takers And there you will see a lot of reviews from about EG Mat and from our EG Mat.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "Matt, so basically I have completed my B.Tech engineering in Electronics and Communication in 2021. So after that I have joined PwC India and I have been doing, I've been working there for two years, 11 months and after that I have taken 1 sabbatical leave and currently I am on that sabbatical leave from last year July. It was the reason I will tell you it was that I wanted to work, I mean prepare for the UPSC examination that is conducted in India. So I have prepared for that exam and by now since it's 7 to 8 months have gone and I thought that it would be better if I have the option of preparing for the CAT as well. And then I did write the CAT exam into that exam and now I'm quite interested in I'm going for the business courses that is in management courses. So I mean, I have got certain level of interest in it. And then I thought since the CAT and that was not the level I expected, the scores were not according to my expectation. I thought it would be better if I give the GMAT now since I have time and I am currently on the sabbatical and mostly I think four to five months would be enough. I mean, I would, I'm not sure about that. Yeah, Indian School of Business, yeah, ISB as well. So I was looking at the best course materials and the mock test that are provided by various institutes. Initially I was looking at the institute that were giving course materials for the CAT, but later I found out that they were not up to the level that is required for GMAT. And then I found that there is there are some of this like the I believe that it is Manhattan Review, then Wardosh. And then I came to know about this one. And then I did a comparative analysis of the two to three of them. And I found that mostly reviews are positive for EG Mat. Somebody told me yesterday, I, I went to chat GP to find out about you guys. No, I was actually looking at the Cora reviews. I mean, I'm not sure in cases it might be biased, it might be not biased, but yeah, that is the I think that is the most available option I had, right. Yeah, I have heard about it, but not have much acquaintance with it. I just look at the website once or twice, Right, Right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prospect’s performance\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "So, and that's a very authentic place because GMAT Club does not allow anybody to post a review unless they submit their original scorecard. So it's authenticated and absolutely, you know, legit, that's what I can say. So yeah, that that would be one place where you can look up what's the target score that you're looking at. That would be the score that would mostly surprise, right, 705 should be a good score for your one AMBA to the Iims and yeah and and so you are ready to put in four to five months for your preparation, right? Otherwise, the other websites or the other, I mean, there's coaching materials, providers are charging exorbitant fees. And also that is mostly difficult for an Indian, you know, because the dollar rates are going up daily. They're crazy, isn't it? It's crazy to see that. Yeah. , are you from West Bengal, Right? Where are you situated now? It's nearby. It's in Hooghly district. Hooghly district? No Bengali as well. Absolutely. So I know that that sound, you know, when people speak. Yeah. So accent. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why I could I could tell that. OK. You're probably from West Bengal. All right. So , any mock tests that you have taken for GMAT? You haven't taken any any preparation. That has gone nothing at all, right? No, nothing. I mean, this is your first, Yeah. CAT and ZAT exam preps were done. Been to GMAT preparation. Got you, got you. And so you were saying that quant is an issue for you, right? Right. Yeah. So giving you a bit of background on this, I I just told you that I have written the CAT and as well as the ZAT exam. Got you, got you. So GMAT want is not that difficult, but GMAT verbal is more difficult than the cat verbal and BI section. So yeah, we will it just kind of balances out and we'll look into all of that. And of course, we have a way way to prepare our students for that. OK, so mantra in any case, I think that given that you this is your first time preparing for GMAT. So I will first give you a demo of a of a study plan that we create at our at our website now and then I will give you a walkthrough of the entire course. So let me just get there and I'll share my screen with you in a bit. And so here we are. All right, let's just get in there. So at some point , while you are, you know, still making that decision, just go to EG map platform and take that mock test. The first mock test is free of cost. And so that way you will also get a little feel of GMAT. And what it'll what it'll do is that your score will start as a starting ability for us to see, like how much time do we need with you in order to work? I think four months should be good enough for you. That's not a problem at all. But yeah, let me start sharing my screen. But, you know, it's always good to take a mock test and then proceed from there. But in any case, we will have to start with the basics of the course. But still, it's, it's just a good starting point. Or if you want to, you know, save your mock, you can do that. Also, we can use all the five mocks at the end of the course. OK, so there will be the five mocks that would be provided, the five full length mocks that we have and then there will be. OK, there will be 5 full length mocks, 50 sectional mocks that we will have and apart from that when you buy a course from EGMAT, we also give you 37 sectional mocks from GMAT club. So that will make total of 80, 7 sectional mocks for you and then five full length mock tests, which is I think pretty good to practice. And then we have other, we have total 5500 questions on our platform . So if you just buy this course, you don't need to buy anything else. You don't even have to buy official guides, those question banks. I mean, you can always go to GMAT club and practice questions from there. You really need not buy them. So let's just say creating a new plan. So I'll just tell you how the planner works. OK, so here we are. So this is the planner I created for somebody yesterday, . And so this person is at 475 when they gave the mock and they are planning to get 685. You're not far behind. I think if you were to give the thing, probably you will also be somewhere here and you are aiming for 7:05, which is 20 points. So more or less the same trajectory that I'm looking at now. All the scores that you look in blue that you see in blue, these are the scores that that person got after giving the mock. So they got SEV V 78, Q 79 and DI 63. Now that they are aiming for 685, the planner decided that OK, in order to get to 685 you have to have some 6 point improvement in verbal, you need about 10 point improvement in quant and you need about use a 16 point improvement in data insights. It is very, very clear that this person is doing fairly poorly in Data insights and Verbal OK. They were good in QANT and that's why their maximum push is coming from QANT. See the idea in EG math is that we will actually leverage on what your strengths are rather than trying to make you a pundit on your weaknesses, which will take a lot more time, which is going to be a lot of struggle for you. OK, so we are not going to do that. For example, this this person is really far behind in data insights. This is not something that come pretty naturally to them. So we thought that OK, if your quant is good, let's push you a little bit on quant followed by verbal and data insights will only get to the point till you can handle it, right? So this is what planner will do. And that's why I'm saying that giving a mock will actually give us the starting scores for you. Also, now the planner gets even more granular when it goes to the point where it also asks you for your subsectional scores that OK, in verbal you got 78, but verbal has CR in RC. Which one are you better at, CR or RC? Depending on that, we will again work on which subsection should we be working on more in order to get to your V-84 faster. So the idea constantly is to be working on your strengths, leveraging on your strengths. For example, this person was very good in arithmetic. I mean, I wouldn't say very good, but yeah, actually they got 84 in arithmetic and they got 29 in algebra. But to balance out the planner, the planner only took 67 percentile. Actually this person got 84 percentile. And so for that person push is coming more on the arithmetic, not so much on algebra, right? So this is going to be the thing for, for throughout. So when we look at that, when all the calculations were done, this is what the planner said that hey, if you start from 13th of Feb, by 14th, 15th of June, you will be able to do the entire course. Now that is happening because this guy is a working professional and he's putting in 20 hours every week. I think that's not going to be the case with you because you are on sabbatical. So I feel that you will be able to spend more time and so you will be able to cover the grounds faster than this person, right. So March, April, May, June, four months. But I, I would say that four months should be a good time to get started with. OK, so let's OK, so this is the planner. Now this is how the planner looks like on your daily commitment. Generally the planner suggests students to start with verbal course because for the very simple fact that verbal course is the smallest course, it just has CR and RC. Now you can also say that hey want also has arithmetic and algebra only. But inside arithmetic there are three divisions.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "So I think based on the institutes that I am trying to get, it would be near about 700. Yeah, right. Because I was looking at the course that EEG might provides that is of the four months and I think going by the prices that would be the mostly the economic option for me, correct, correct. Yeah, Yeah. Yes. Calcutta. No, not in Calcutta. I'm from Calcutta, Born, brought up, raised. So yes, I'm an out and out Kolkata girl. I I'm in Sham Bazaar, Richila Manit Akono Archie like my my place is in Shasham Bazaar. I can read, write and speak. That was my third language, Yes. So, you know, and that's why I can figure out like when people speak. No, for GMAT I haven't taken. I haven't right. So on those I was able to score, I'm in over 90 percentile in the verbal section that is in VI part. But the problem was with the quant section where I faltered in both of them and it pulled my score down. And so I've spoken to a lot of people coming after coming to coming to prepare for GMAT, after giving their cat and they all told me that, you know, compared to GMAT, the cat quant is more difficult. OK, Why my own teams? Oh no, actually not because I don't have your scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent drawing up plan\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "They are called number properties, word problems and advanced topics. So arithmetic actually covers a lot of topics inside it. And so our quant course is actually very tedious. It's a long course and then in DI you have 4 subsections to deal with DSGITA, MSR and TPA. So let's get started with verbal because that's the shortest course to, to master. And this is what your planner will say that OK, if you're starting from today, you start studying from today, then you know, you start with master comprehension course. And then master comprehension course is an additional course, , which actually teaches you how to read because well, I, I am majorly a verbal expert. And so when we finished our verbal offering to the students, we decided that hey, we should teach them how to read. Because generally what happens in verbal is that people come back to reread the passage to answer every question, be it your RC passage or CR passage. So if that is the thing, then we need to cut down on that time and teach them how to read properly. So that's what you see that your course is starting with master comprehension course, which requires you 7 hours to put in your thing. Now would it be 7 hours for you? I'm not sure because you are already doing pretty well in verbal. It's the quant that is, you know, kind of posing issues with you. So once you give the mock and I have your scores from there, then it will be easier for us to determine whether you really need to spend this kind of a time on your verbal or not. For example, you see this person was struggling, I mean they are start struggling with their CR. So they are recommended to do the CR course in 48 hours. May not be the case with you. Probably you're already doing pretty good with CR and instead of 48 hours, you actually need to spend just about 32 or 33 hours, right? So the planner will actually show you the time and account for every single day according to your starting ability. And that's why MOB becomes a little important. Any questions over here, ? No, it's absolutely automated. It is exactly the way mock test official mock tests work. So the entire test is going to be adaptive, OK. And you can select the section. If you you can select your section whether you want to take want first, you want to take DI 2nd and like how in whichever order you want to take. If you do not decide your order, then the default order will be quant, verbal, NDI, OK with a 10 minute break in between somewhere again so you can decide how you want to put your break and in which order you want to take. The test is going to be adaptive as you know it's going going to give you the real GMAT feel and scores will be immediately shown to you so much so that your report card will also be ready right after that where you can see that which questions did you get wrong? How much time did you get? You know, let me show you this real quick. So if I were to show you what all you will see once you do your mock test, it's better that I show you this person's account open up. OK, thank you. So this is going to be your. So this is how you're going, how it's going to look, right? When you start your mock, it will ask you for your target score. And when you finish your mock, it will also give you this thing that, OK, you are this much behind from your target score, right? So this is what's it's going to be. And then you will see that, OK, this is your sectional performance. In verbal, you have 80, which is 60th percentile. In quant, you have 77, which is 46 percentile. In Data Insights, you have 76, which is 58 percentile, and then you can actually click on this Analyze verbal section over here and then it will give you everything, OK, you've gotten in CR, you've gotten 68, so you need to get to 93. In RC, you've gotten 58. You need to get to 96. When you analyze the raw data, then everything will be. Invisible to you that so it will also tell you, OK, this was the split of your question. 23 out of 23 questions, 11 were critical reasoning, 12 were RC. This is your average time for correct answer choices for incorrect answer choices. And then if you just, you know, stop the enhanced view, then this is the this is your time management report that will show so which question you got wrong? How many questions did you get right? What, what was the amount of time that you spent on all of these questions? And if you Scroll down a little bit, then it will give you all the details about the questions that you did. What topic did it come from? Then what sub topic did it come from? What was the difficulty level of that? What did you get it right? Did you get it wrong? And how much time did you spend? And then the solution for every question, the review of that question would be there like what did you select and what was the correct answer? So this will be generated right after you do your work, immediately after that, OK. And then what I can do is that , is that whenever you are done doing your mob, just leave me a message. You have my number. Just leave me a WhatsApp message and tell me, you know, Shraddha, I'm done with my mom. So what I can do is that I can take a look at it and I can analyze it for you. I'll record a video analyzing that, OK? This is how you did. This is where we need to work. These are the problems that you're facing. This is the bottlenecks that I can identify, and these are the solutions that we can work on. I can do that and I can create a study plan based on your mock scores and I can share that with you over the WhatsApp as well. OK? OK. All right, So with that, now that we see just a second here, OK, OK, so I just need to move this over here real quick. OK, so let's go back to our planner over here. So as you can see, you know you will be finishing. So every single course you will be finishing in two stages, Stage 1 and stage 2, and then there will be a stage 3. So basically let me take you here right now. The planner is not optimal to our needs. So this is our course menu Verbal. Apart from CR and RC, I told you there's one extra course skill building master comprehension course in quant. The first number properties, word problems and advanced topics. These are arithmetic topics for you and algebra is algebra. We have something called quant basics, . We have called Quant basics which is which helps students to basically revise topics that are that they will see in their quant. So this will be a good starting point for you Shamantho to get your basics revised first and then get into the core preparation for GMAT Quant because this is where you are facing problem. Then comes data insights. Of course, in data insights we have all the four topics that are covered. Now what does not change across the three sections are the three stages of learning that we have. As you can see, stage 1, Stage 2 and stage 3. So what do we do in Stage 1? Stage 1 is all about learning the concepts and learning the process. OK, so when I take you to say CR, I'll show you how everything is done there and how you will learn all the concepts and the process to solve CR questions. Once your stage one in CR is done or any subsection is done, then you will have to move to the stage 2 of that particular subsection. In the Stage 2 of that particular subsection, you will only be practicing questions now only of medium and hard level. Mind you, we are looking at seven O 5 which is 96th percentile, actually 98th percentile. Seven O 5 is 98th percentile. So in order to get to that 98th percentile, we will have to answer medium and hard questions that those are the questions that we need to face on our exam in order to get to that higher 90th percentile. OK. And that is what we were we are going to do in Stage 2. Then comes stage 3. Stage 3 you will only come at when you are done both the subsections like all the subsections under that particular section. Say for verbal you'll have to finish CR and RC. For quant, you'll have to finish all the four word problem number properties, advanced topic and algebra and data insights. All the four topics you'll have to finish stage 1 and stage 2. Then we will take you to test readiness for that particular section. So once you are done with CR and RC, we will will now give you sectional mocks. In sectional mocks, we will compare your first performance with your mock attempt and we will see that after putting in all the all the effort, how far you have come closer to your? How closer have you come to your target score? OK, this will be repeated for Verbal, Quant and DI and once your entire course is done, we will reserve your 4 mocks for the end of your prep. Right at the end, we will give you mocks one day after the other just to put you into the momentum so that you are prepared for your test. OK, so after that you can go ahead and write your exam. So let's look into what is there in stage 1 of verbal and how to do it. So we will start with master comprehension course. As I was already telling you, Shamantha, that master comprehension is a core building, core skill building module or a course where we teach you how to read actively. Generally, you know, we we read a lot, we read newspapers and novels and and non fiction and all sorts of things. But generally, because we don't have questions to answer after that, we are not very engaged with the passage and that's why the retention and recall of information is not very high, right? But we cannot read like that when it comes to verbal questions or for that matter DI questions. The DI verbal questions, OK, we need to be become lot more active with our passages in CRNRC. So what happens is that when we engage more actively with the passage, our understanding of the passage increases by 80%. Our retention of information increases significantly and because of the increase in retention of the information, the recall also improves a lot. Our recall ability also improves a lot. So when that happens, we are able to answer questions without having to waste time to reread the passage. So that's a very efficient way of answering questions. And you will see that this skill will come very handy with verbal and also with verbal questions in DI. OK. So I think given that your verbal is stronger than your other two sections, you will not even take 7 hours to do it. You will be able to finish this course in five hours. And so if I look at your mock score, , then I will be able to tell you probably you will just have to do Module 3, Module 4, and the first four lessons in Module 5. Probably I'll not even ask you to go through the entire MC course because you seem to have that ability already. It's just that we'll just prepare the ground for you. Then we will move on to CR. Now in our verbal course, both CR and RC, they start with Foundation Concepts, followed by the different kind of CR or RC questions that we face on GNAT. For CR, the first module is your Foundation Concepts where we teach you how to identify conclusions in different kind of CR passages. Because conclusion is that one main part of any argument around which mostly the question comes OK and then there are 6 different types of CR questions Inference, assumption, evaluate, strengthen, weaken and boldface. Out of these six, inference and assumption are the primary topics. Evaluate, strengthen, weaken and boldface are the secondary topics. Why? Because strengthen and weaken are nothing but influence kind of a questions with a little bit more specificity, OK? But and the skills that you will learn in the assumption file, they will help you answer evaluate and boldface questions. So 2 primary topics will help you take care of the four secondary topics. OK, so let's get into our inference module. Inference module, we have 14 lessons look pretty looks pretty daunting. But our every single module also has a structure. In the first part of every module, you will learn the concepts. OK, so in the inference module, just the first five lessons are inference or are the concept files? OK, just the first one. Here you learn all the mandatory concepts you need to need to know to answer inference questions correctly. The second part of the module are the application files where we teach you three-step process to answer every single CR question. When you learn the process, you know how to process the passage, you know how to extract the exact demand of the question, and then you will know how to interpret the answer choices so that you can reject the incorrect answer choices confidently and you can choose the correct answer choice with super confidence. OK, so this is going to happen when you learn the process. Third part of every module are the practice files where you will bring together the concepts and the process to solve GMAP like questions. These stars are there by the side of all the right chapters. What exactly they mean correct. So these are the things that we are looking at now for quiz files having a score percentage, it is absolutely fine, right? I mean, definitely yours quizzes will be scored, but there are quiz files in the concepts as well. So even before the concept, you will see a small quiz and then your concept will go for about 11:50 minutes and then every concept ends with another post assessment quiz. So these quizzes are look, are like those class tests, you know, which we used to get after every two to three weeks, you know, teachers would just teach 2 chapters from, from some book and then they would say, OK, we will have a class assessment, 20 marks or 25 marks, whatever. So that was just to make sure that whatever we have learned, we've learned it well. This is the same idea that we have put in our concepts that we end every single lesson with a post assessment quiz, just to make sure to know how well you have learned the concept. So as you can see, this particular student, she has gotten 92 in her first one. You see wherever she's gotten 100, the star is completely covered, right?\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "I have been working with EG MAP for the last 13 1/2 years. Yeah, so I mean I would be giving the mock then within maybe today or tomorrow whenever I get the time I would attain the mock test. And so it will be is it going to be an auto generated report that will open up after I give the mock or will you and the team would put airport and then would come up with this one. I mean, how I will get this plan? Sure. Any questions before I move further ? Nothing from here, I mean just one thing I saw on the screen. Very nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Explaining product\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "But wherever she's gotten 75, you know, it's just 1-2. Third is covered, 1/3 actually 1/4. 1/4 is not. 1/4 is not covered. So yeah, these are basically according to the score that you have or that she has gotten basically. But the idea is that should you be getting 100% in all the quizzes otherwise it will not be considered a good score. Well, that is not the case. Your score will be considered good if you stay above the median for that particular quiz. Now you can ask Sushruta, how do I know what is the median for these quizzes and how much is my target? So in order to know that, I'm gonna show you something right now you are looking at the course in the modules view and that's why you can see all the modules that CR course has, right? But there is another view over here which is called the journey view. When we click on journey view, we don't see modules anymore. Now we see the learning levels in our CR course and you can see that how students are graded over here. OK, Your idea is to get grade A in all these learning levels and how to make how to get to grade A, How do I know that I've gotten grade A or how to get grade A? This is where all the median scores for that particular lesson or that particular quiz in that lesson has been mentioned, right? So for the first one, it's 80%. Whenever you score more than the median, you are given grade A. When you score equal to the median, that's when you earn grade B Falling below the median will give you grade C, which is a big red flag. We shouldn't be getting grade C. If grade C happens, then you have two options to work on . The first would be is that you will be given a mentor the moment you decide to come on board, EG MAP. So you're not alone in this journey. There is always a mentor who's looking at your performance and keeping track of things that you're doing on the platform so that whenever you need their help, they can always diagnose your performance and they can come up with proper solutions for you. So you can reach out to them and say, hey, listen, I was doing pretty good with my first 6-7 lessons, but in my 8th lesson, I suddenly got grade C. Can you please evaluate and tell me what do I, what did I not do correctly and how to fix this? So your, you know, mentor will again get back to you saying, hey, this was the thing, this was the thing, you did not do this right. You did not do this right. Do these things and things will be fine. That's one way of doing it. Another thing of doing is self-assessment. In self-assessment, what you will do is that take a look at the solution of that question that you might have gotten wrong and or maybe questions that you might have gotten wrong and compare your process with the process or compare your solution with the solution given in the in the course and then compare that. What is it that you missed out on which made you choose incorrect answer choices? You can create a error log at this point in time also to make sure that, OK, I missed out this thing in this question, I'm not supposed to do this. This is the fixing point and all of that. When you do this exercise, it's just that you become more aware of your weaknesses. And when you attempt the next lesson or the next quiz with the awareness of the weakness, you will be conscious not to repeat that error. And so your accuracy will always, your accuracy will already improve if we have this thing. So this is how we will go about getting grade A from one lesson to another, keeping above the median. Always remember , that Stage 1 is the stage where we are learning all the concepts and we are learning the processes. So any course correction that has to happen will happen in stage 1 because stage 2 and Stage 3 are just our practice stages. The the stage 2 is not the stage where we learn anything or there is a scope for course course correction. Let's just learn things very nicely over here and then let's just, you know, do our practice really, really nicely to improve our accuracy and efficiency. Any questions? No, nothing from here looks good. So let's go back to our one quick thing. You mentioned about the mentor that I will be connecting. So , if you buy the course, you'll have to let me know that you have purchased the course. Then I will share an e-mail with you and you can write on that e-mail and you can say that, hey, I've purchased the course and can you please assign my mentor? So the mentor would be given to you right on day one. But you can choose to keep in touch with your mentor as frequently as you want. If you want to keep in touch with them every single day that hey, listen, this is what I finished today according to my study plan, everything is going fine, whatever. Or you can reach out to them at, at these points where you are facing difficulty and you, you, you don't know how to go about it. So you can always ask for the feedback. So it totally depends upon you how frequently you want to get in touch with your mentor. But your communication with your mentor will happen over emails. You know, after, after we finish our call, I'll send you an e-mail and in that e-mail I'll attach a video that will talk about how our mentorship works. OK, and I'll talk to you about one more thing, but that's later. First, let's just get done with our stage 1. So this is how we will finish Stage 1 , finishing our foundations concept, then inference module and then assumption module. And as you make this transition from primary concepts to secondary concepts, you will see that your modules have become shorter because whatever main thing that you had to learn, the learnings will all happen in your primary, primary modules. In secondary modules, we will focus more on more practice and more application. OK, so once that is done, your once you have finished all the lessons in on your dashboard of CR, your CR Stage 1 is over. Now it's time you have learned all the concepts, you have learned the application of process and you have practiced enough questions in your Stage 1 to know how to apply the process. Now it's time to amp up the game a little bit. And so we will take you to Stage 2. Let's just move this a bit now. Stage 2, how will we do Stage 2? So we will go back to our course menu and here we will click on Verbal Scholaranium. Scholaranium is the name of our quizzing platform, right? So now. It's pretty much integrated in the course itself. So here we will come and we will do some quizzes. Now quizzes in stage 2 are called cementing quizzes and I'll tell you why we call them cementing quizzes. Now these cementing quizzes are divided into two categories, medium cementing and hard cementing. How will you clear medium cementing? You will be asked to take 5 quizzes out of which three must have at least 70% accuracy. OK, once we have that graph on your dashboard, we see that OK, three quizzes are there with 70% or more accuracy. Then you will be asked to do your hard cementing. Hard cementing, again, you will do 5 questions over 5 quizzes over here. And then for hard cementing, your criteria is to get at least 55% accuracy in three out of the five quizzes that you will attempt. Any questions? No, nothing here. OK, Now the only requirement that we have over here, , is that when you do your medium cementing or hard cementing, when you're taking those 5 cementing quizzes, do them together. Don't do them like OK, I'll take two cementing today and I'll take 2 medium cementing tomorrow. Not like that. We will try to finish all the five cementing quizzes in one go. Why? The reason behind that is it is again the same principle. Now these questions, these quizzes are not too long. They are just about 5 questions or six questions. So they will not take too long to finish. So you finish one set of question, one set of quiz, and suppose you got one or two questions wrong. You identify that. Was it inference question, assumption question? Boldface question? Whatever it is, you identify the topic and then you go back to the course. And of course you're not expected to do the entire module. Suppose you got one inference question wrong. Just go to anyone application file. What's the solution for two questions over there and compare that solution with your own process. Just because there are only three steps to answer any CR question, you will be able to identify whether you faltered in step one, Step 2, or step three. That record will go in your error log. OK, so now you are aware that this is the area where I'm not focusing pretty much. I need to work on that. With that thought process, when you attempt your second set of quiz, now you will be aware, conscious to do things the right way. So with this way, in this way, when you keep doing one set of the quiz after the other, it's just that you're closing out all the possibilities to continue with your error. This will lead to better accuracy, right? That's one thing. Second thing that will happen at in, in, in your cementing process is that you will be, you know, solving about 25 to 30 questions in your medium and about 25 to 30 questions in your hard quizzes. That means by the time you are done with critical reasoning, you would have solved 60 questions only on your cementing platform, only on stage 2, which is, which is an amazing a number of questions to get the process cemented right. It's just, it's like, you know, somebody gave you a, a, a song to play on piano and you are given 6 hours to do that. Obviously by the end of 6th hour, you will be much better than playing that song than you were at the end of the first hour, right? Because you kept playing, kept playing. You, you know, you practice, you develop the muscle memory, you know the process now what to do. And so your time taken to answer questions will come down, which means that your process is getting ingrained. And that's why we call this quiz cementing quiz because the process is getting cemented. We are cementing your accuracy also by making sure that you get medium and high questions right consistently Make sense got it all righty. So once your CR is done, it's time to go back to the course and get started with your RC course. RC course again stage 1 again, as you're saying  that you are doing you are you're pretty good with verbal. I mean that looks like your strong point. If you score good percentage in your mock test, then you may not have to go through the entire stage 1. You may directly start with stage 2, for example. I'll just take you to the planner and I'll show you what I mean by that. So this particular student who, whose planner I was sharing you with, he, I told you that person is good in quant, right? So if you look at their quant, see here, they did not start with stage one in their number properties. They actually started with stage 2 because in arithmetic they already had 84th percentile. So there is no problem with the concepts in this person. There could be some process issue here and there or maybe some topics here and there that that person needed help with, but they will not have to go through the rigor of sitting through each and every concept, right? So if this is the case with you for verbal, then we will get you directly started with cementing off here. I'll just close it out. Yeah, so we can get you directly started with cementing over here and you will not have to go through the entire course, right? But just say that you may have to go through then. In that case, your stage 1 is already there. We've already explained it to you. You will start with the foundations concepts. Now there are not too many concepts to be learnt in RC. You need to learn a lot of strategies how to stay, remain focused in the passage. What is it that you need to do to answer questions correctly? What is it that you must not focus on at all when you are analyzing your passage? So these things will be all taught to you in in our strategies. And then the four, the next 4 modules are the next are the four kind of questions that you face in RC. So we will give you a little introduction to that, like how they are written and what to expect, how to answer those questions. And these are actually smaller concept files, smaller modules because you know, once you learn the strategies, you will know how to answer these questions. And then finally, we will bring you to the first RC application file where you will have 9 passages starting with four easy graduating to 5 medium. And finally, we will finish our entire RC stage one with seven hard passages, so 7 and 916 passages. Practice, solid practice right on stage 1 even before we take you to cementing. So with the end of application file too, you will be done with your stage one in RC and then you will come here and do your cementing for RC. The criteria for medium cementing and hard cementing remain the same all across the subsection. We will need three out of five with 70% or more for medium, and we would need three out of five with at least 5055% in for your hard cementing. Any questions? Nothing from here. All right, I mean, I'm gonna do it. Yeah. Good. So once your CR and RC are done, we did them separately. Right now it's time to take you to the test readiness stage, the Stage 3 because you have completed both the subsections in verbal, in text sectional. In stage 3, we will be giving you sectional marks, 45 minutes, 23 questions. These will be timed and adaptive, exactly the way things work in GMAP. And so we will see that how closer you have come to your target verbal score after putting all the hard work that you have done so far. So here again, your mentors would come into picture to help you navigate through what will be considered a successful mark, what will not be considered a successful mark, What you need to do if you successfully complete your sectional marks, what you need to do if you do not do so, right? So all those assistants will come through your mentor when you actually get to that stage. Once this is done, once your mentors give you a green signal that hey, you know, your sectional marks, marks look good, it has been done successfully. Your verbal course is done successfully. You can now move on to the quant. So this is where you will require more attention, , because that's what you're saying that hey, listen, you know, my quant course is my quant is kind of pulling me down. So basically you will go the very same way. First module. So first you will have to spend some time on quant basics. Your planner will also say that. And then one module after the other. But in our quant we have something called pace view, which is a very unique engine. So what happens when the pace view is on? Basically what happens is that every module starts with a diagnostic quiz. OK, now when the diagnost. So when you give the diagnostic quiz and the system decides what are your strengths and what are your weaknesses, you don't need to work on your strengths at all. You only focus on your weaknesses. So out of you know, whatever we had 1110 because the first one is diagnostic was quiz. So that will be always open for you. But for this particular student, she was pretty good with her basics basics knowledge, and so out of eight lessons, she only had to focus on two. The rest 6 she did not have to worry about because she was already doing rest 8 she did not have to worry about because she has. She's already doing pretty good in that. Basically the idea behind putting the PACE system is that to keep the quant course absolutely personalized and customized according to your need. OK so this is how we will go from 1 module to another. Just one thing will change once you get to the main topics. 1 basics is just covering just brushing up right? Your main topic starts from number properties, word problems, advanced topic and algebra. You will see that in these topics, the core arithmetic topics, the modules have become longer and instead of only one diagnostic quiz, you will now have two diagnostic quizzes, one on concept just to check whether you know that concept well or not. And the second one would be testing your skill. Because see, it's just not about answering the questions correctly. It's also about answering those questions correctly in a stipulated time frame, right? You will have, you will only have 45 minutes to do all your 21 questions. So that requires certain skills because calculator is not allowed, right? So we, you need to learn the process skills in order to answer the questions in the correct way efficiently. So again, the system will decide how, what all concepts you need to work on and what all process skills you need to learn. So that that so this is what this is what is the speciality of pace you that with your diagnostic quizzes, the system will be recommending you what to study and what not to study. It will just help you focus on your weaknesses and focus them focus on them really well. Any questions? So is it? So what you need to do is that you just turn off the pace view, OK? Just click on this button, OK? Once you, you know, turn it off, then no matter what score you get in diagnostic, everything will be accessible to you. Got it. OK. But if you want to make it more customized, then just keep your pace view on, keep giving your diagnostic and let the system decide what to study, what not to study, OK. Yeah. So both ways it is possible. OK, So yeah, pretty much the same way of doing things. . For our quant also, you will first do number properties, stage one. Once all the modules are done, then you will go to quant Scholaranium where you will do cementing for number properties. Then you will come back to the course, do word problem stage 1, finish all the lessons and all the modules, and then you will go to Scholaranium and you will finish stage 2 cementing medium and hard for this. Same with advanced topic, staying with algebra also. So let me take you to the quant Scholaranium. So yeah, this is pretty much that you will do over here and alone in your in your Scholaranium section, you will be getting around 200 to 240 question practice once you finish your medium and hard cementing for each and every subsection, right. So the the process remains the same once your arithmetic and algebra are done, just like you had sectional mocks in your verbal, now you will be doing sectional mocks for your quant 45 minutes, 21 questions and then we will see how well you have fared with this. Makes sense. OK. So now that this is done, you will go back to the course and now it's time to finish up everything with your DI course. In DI course again the drill remains the same. You'll start with data sufficiency stage 1, stage 2. Then you will do Gita stage 1, stage 2. Then you will do two-part analysis stage 1, stage 2 and then you will do Multi Source reasoning Stage 1, stage 2. So this way, you will be done with your DI course as well in the same way that you have done your verbal and quant. So another 240 question you will be solving just in your stage 2 while doing the cementing quizzes. And then once again, sectional marks. Once the sectional mocks are completed, it's the last leg of your preparation where you will now just be giving mock tests in order to make sure that you're absolutely ready for prepare. At this point in time, , basically your focus would be on, OK, what are my strategies? Any exam anxiety that you may have any you know a test temperamental issues that we may have. So those things will be fixed in the last 4-5 to six days that we will keep only for the test ready test stage. So here I was giving you a walkthrough to through through a student of ours who was in our system a year ago. So she started with 555. That was her starting point. She wanted to score 6, 95 and so she actually got a 695 in her exam also and she was able to achieve that in two months. And so yeah, that is the thing. If you go to GMAT club and if you look up Leela in EGMAT review, you will see her review that she did make that 140 point improvement in two months time. So yeah, I guess that's all from my side  and now I'm ready to answer any questions that you may have for me. So what exactly? Oh, OK. Well, those are just different kind of questions that we have. Certain questions are called gold, certain questions are platinum. They are basically for our identification whether they belong to the mock pool or they belong to the cementing pool or they belong to stage 1 pool. OK, OK. Yeah, those are basically for internal stuff that we have. Yeah. So it would be difficult to again recall and sometimes things would go away completely from the mind. Yeah, keep in touch with all of them, right. So we, we do consider that point, . But what will happen is that you, so that's why we have 50 sectional marks. We have 15 sectional marks for each of each and every section. So what happens is that you will say you are starting with quant. When you're starting with quant, your entire focus is on learning quant. You know, we'll leave you, we'll, we will leave you in the world of quant where you will breathe quant, eat quant, sleep quant, dream quant, right. So that it totally gets into your system. After that, once your quant is fixed, which which is what we want to do, we will take you to verbal. We will still give you quant sectional marks every single weekend to work on to keep honing your skills. So that is part of your plan and your mentor will actually be telling you about that, that now that you have moved to . Give me two seconds. OK. So, yeah, that facility is already given in Trumantra that you will be doing sectional mocks. So when you come to verbal, you will do quant sectional mocks along with your verbal. And when you move to DI which is your last section, you will be doing quant mock as well as verbal mock both so that also so that you don't go out of the practice. OK, got it. Yeah and there will be 30, there will be 37 sectional mocks from GMAT club also. So you can do, you can avail those sectional mocks at this point in time as well. OK. It would be difficult. Correct. So if you're giving five hours , this is your weekdays. Will anything change on weekends or it it doesn't matter? Right now you're on sabbatical weekdays, right? I that is the reason I took five hours on average because got you, got you.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "Like what am I really targeting for to achieve? OK, yeah. So will I be provided with one mentor from the initial stages or I have to, I mean, put somewhere that I have problem here and please assign me a mentor. Like how is it work, right? From where did I make this mistake? So one thing, let's say in the diagnostic quiz gives me a green signal that I can go ahead skipping those below concepts. But let's say I want to look at the concepts so that it would help me brush up once again. And if I have something lacking, I can cover the gap there. Will it they be available to me if I want or yes. OK, yeah. What is my section? How shall I be writing my G match really to make the maximum out of my strengths. So one of the question here that I saw in the stage two of all of those, there were something platinum written by the side of it. Also another thing I was thinking as you said, the planner Will most likely do a plan that includes first the verbal section, then the quants and then DI or maybe any other way around. But right, let's say I am doing the verbal or the quant at the very beginning and it's, I mean, for 1 1/2 months or two months, I'm doing the other things. And I got totally cut off from the concept that I learned on, I mean, 1 1/2 months ago. So is there any possibility that a plan be made where, I mean, concepts and practices would be juggled between the coherence and then, right, different sections. Your point is absolutely valid that now that I'm going to spend next four weeks on verbal, what happens to my quant practice and the quant processes that I have learned? I just need to I think I can do it from here. Yeah, sure. My battery is running low and for some reason user is not charging. So yeah, that is basic basically not very much of the questions that I had. Now what I would ask you that let's say I am able to commit 5 hours a day right daily. I mean, I won't overcome it that I would be giving 7 to 8 hours, then things not happen the right way. So let's say I'm taking an average 5 hours a day and how much would it take to complete the preparation in that case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Price discussion\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "So you will be, yeah, giving 35 hours every week right now, right. It could be so that you can do, you can do, you will take anything between two to four months to finish your course. But then again, , one thing we'll have to keep in mind is that I still don't know your starting ability. So so you know, what you can do is that you can start your preparation. You know, let's just go buy a 2 month course. OK, given the fact that you are doing this, you you'll have to start with your basics, Quan basics to Shuru karna here. We'll have to start from Quan. There's no two ways about it. You can go ahead, buy a 2 month course and start preparing and then you know, we can look into if you need any extension. Then you can always get extensions. There are extensions available and you will say that, OK, 15 days extension costs you $49. One month extension costs you $89.00. So what do you want to do? Otherwise, one thing you can do is that you can say, hey, listen, I don't want to get into the trouble of extensions. Now I'm gonna work out a little math for you, , because you're on sabbatical, I think I I can offer you a discount on both the courses. OK, OK, so say the two-month course costs you 199. OK, and the four month course costs 299. OK, suppose you buy a 2 month course and you get extension. Say you think that. Oh no, you know, maybe your planner says you need 8. You need four more weeks or five more weeks to prepare and you get an extension for $89.00 and so your three month course will be valid for which you would be paying $288 for the four month course which is for 299. I can give you a discount of $50 on that and you can have the course for $249 and remain retain the course for four months. And so that way you will not be rushed to do your preparation and you will not also have that tension of kind of extending and doing this and that also. So that is also one of the options. Yes, there can be a discount on the two-month course. So even then, your two-month course plus one month extension in case if you need to do that, you will be paying $248. But if you pay $249, your course will be valid for four months without having to worry about any extensions or whatsoever. So this is how the math work out. You can take, you can think about it and then let me know. But yeah, once we get a mock from you then we will be more confident about the kind of time that you would require to get from your starting ability to seven O 5. OK. So you are basically suggesting that first I take the mock and then I go ahead with buying the course. You buy a 249 course for four months and you save that free mock so that by the end of your course you have all the five mocks. OK. Otherwise what you can do is that you can take a mock and I can create a study plan for you and then you can decide whether you want. I mean, extensions are always you know, you have to reach out to the team and then they will have to do extension, you'll have to pay again and so on and so forth. So it does not even put a pressure on you to take a mock like immediately. But you can still go ahead and take a mock and then we can create a planner for you. But you know that you will not have to waste any more day waiting to buy the course. You know, after you do your mock and stuff, you can go ahead, make the purchase and then you can start, start preparation right away. That's gonna be the thing. The planner will be there. I mean, we can just create the planner for you. Sure that works fine. So every single section is 45 minutes. So you have 45 into 3, OK. And plus you have a 10 minute break in between the sections so you can decide whenever you want to take your break. So this will take you approximately 2 hours to finish everything. Got it. So yeah, that would be pretty much fine. So I would take them off test tomorrow and then yeah, I will go ahead. Start with the preparation right so let me know Sumanto , because if you plan to go with the four month course, the discount will probably not be there on the website. I will have to create that code for you. So if you write to me, I will generate that code for you. So, so yeah. So just let me know and then we can work on it. And then you when you take the mock test, I can can quickly analyse it, create a video, create your personalized planner for you also on your on your account itself, and then I can send it to you. That works well. Alrighty, alrighty, , you have my number in case if you have any other questions or you need resources other than you know, say college profiling or you know, difference between round one, round two, round 3, so on and so forth. Whatever it is, just let me know and I will be able to help you out with things. What exactly is this thing? Oh, OK, so there are so OK, to be very honest, I'm not sure whether they do this for executive programs or also or not. But in two year MBA program there are different rounds in which you can apply. So the round one starts in somewhere in July, OK, July end. So basically in round one, what happens is that all the seats are available and so there is a deadline to apply for round one. So then after the till the deadline, whatever applications the colleges get, all the seats may not be filled up right. So they will give it to the to the appropriate candidates who they feel are appropriate. And then whatever seats will be left, Round 2 will be open for application to fill up the remaining seats.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "OK, I have to appear on the test. I mean, it's good. Let me just buy the four month course. Now you can also say that OK, you're giving me a discount on four month course. Will not there be any discount on one month course? Say I take out $40 from that. I mean the the thing you are suggesting most likely looks as well as what I thought out that four months would be the yeah, I mean most optimal thing as well as it would be the most economic thing from all points of view if I correct, correct. I would also so see there are there are two things to that. I think a four month course will be OK. But I think that a four month course works out on all the way. And the plan will also be in front of me, right? I believe so I would attend the mock test most likely by tomorrow I will get some free time tomorrow. So I how much long is it? I'm, I mean, I'm don't have much idea about the length of the GMAT test. You can go ahead and purchase the course in that isn't analog to tell you that is not on the website Yeah, I, I will definitely need the code from you right, right. OK, sure, definitely makes sense. OK, so round one, round two, round three, I didn't get it.\n",

      "Q&A\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "And so there is a cutoff for filing your application for round two also. Then again, the filtration will happen, the sorting will happen and they will fill up as many seats as they can from the from the applications that they get. It could be so that they did not get good enough applications for round two and some seats are still left. So for that they will open up round 3, which will happen somewhere in in January end or something like that. For Indian schools, it's generally like that. So they will open third round and by third round their idea is to you know, just get all the seats filled up. So that is what's going to happen. I will figure that out and I'll let you know. But it's good that you apply in first around itself because then the number of seats are absolutely. I mean, it's it's, it's a it's an open house. So basically ISB does select candidates from GMAT for two years MBA. Absolutely. That is right. Absolutely. Absolutely. ISB is definitely a good one and you can you can take a look at other ones as well and then do your analysis. And then if you feel you're doing so much man at any which way, if you you know, get a two year program, why not to try for that? So that won't correct. Any return on investment would be very less on that correct. Correct. Correct. Absolutely. No, no two ways about that. Yeah. You have to look into your return of investment. So yeah, if you're doing it, then do it from a good school. Makes complete sense. Yeah. Yeah. So that is the thing basically. Good, good. Not an issue at all. OK, So man, just so see what I was telling that yeah, I selected the executive MBA option and that is that was what communicated to you. So yeah, correct. Correct. So yeah. So yeah, that basically that's that's how I got you attended the call and you said that that was your requirement. But I'll keep this thing in mind. Also, I'm putting down in my personal notes that even it's not necessarily that you will go for executive, but you will pay your options for both. And so you will look into the profiles. I'll try and share the profile of some of the good Indian colleges for two year course. So you know, look out for that resource. So that would also be a option I might think about and analyze. But right, yeah, why not? So what I'll do is that I will share those resources with you, you know, resources of the college profiles, some in US, some in Europe and some in India, so that you can do your research. Once you have the baseline knowledge, then you can, you know, find out more a little bit by doing your own search. So I will send those resources with you so that you also have those things to look into. Yeah, you definitely can do that. Yeah. So yeah, first thing is getting a good G math score. Yeah, go ahead. ISB does require exactly the same kind of They will require Sops, they will require letter of recommendation, they will want you to write 2 essays about how you know your achievements and your work, you know, work profile, your leadership qualities, your strengths and your weaknesses and how do you try to overcome them and your purpose of doing MBA so on and so forth. So, so application is almost the same. Yes, the, the content changes a little bit depending upon the depending upon the profile of the college that you're trying to apply for. But for that, you know, application part, basically  people generally work with professional, professional consultants who those who can help you, they will look into your profile, they will assess your profile and they will say, OK, this is what your GMAP score is, this is what your profile is. We will for this college, we will turn your profile in this way for this particular college, we will make it little bit more friendly to that particular college ethics, you know.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "But do they do it for executive program or not that I will have to figure out whether IIMA and IIMC and ISB does do that. And also I mean, I would consider A2 year MBA as well if I get any good College in India. And I really have a great course. give me SPGN is also there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, SPGN is also there. I was talking to somebody yesterday and they were saying that they want to do their MBA in finance major and so they are actually looking at this PGN for for admissions. Yes, yeah. So basically I think I have knowledge about these two good colleges in India that offer two year MBA based on the GMAT scores. I don't have much idea about what other colleges offer based on the GMAT, if they offer any two year MBA or not. So yeah, that I would also weigh in as an option if I get correct scoring GMAT for the two year NBA as well. If I get any top tier colleges, then it would be worth it. Yeah, yeah, definitely that, yeah. No, no, I I mean, I would consider if it is a good college because see my situation is that I am now I am in PwC India. So that wouldn't be good if I do a two year MBA from any of the Tier 2 colleges. But if I get something like FP, Jan, ISB or let's say Jamnalal Bajaj or XLRI, so that would definitely be a cream institute to, I mean, get into the world of business. But yeah, I would also weigh in if I get good colleges for two year MBA. I'll be I'll be sharing it to you, sharing it because most likely I would be doing it in India because I'm not very much into going abroad, whereas I haven't given, I mean read that thought into that aspect as well. But yeah, I would have to see if I mean, there are good institutes outside India which are really worth it and people go there. But since I have not much idea about the institutes, like I have only heard of a few good institutes like maybe Harvard, Wharton and those schools. But yeah, so other than that, I don't have much more idea. I if I get the knowledge of those, I would be able to understand how I can apply for them. And if I get, I mean, enrolled, get their admission into some good cool, why not? That would also be an option for me, right? So that that is basically all I have. Yeah, Yeah. Sure. One more thing I was saying I what I believe is the process for applying in those schools as well as the profile requirement are totally different from those going to Indian business schools, right? What I understand or is it the application requirement is almost the same? I mean I know about ISB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wrap\n",
      "Agent:\n",
      "So these things happen and there are consultants, there are professional consultants, admission consultants who can do that for you. At the moment, unfortunately, , there are talks that EG Mat will eventually come to that level, come to that point where we will start doing this for our students. But as of now, we don't have that. This is not only ISB, this is not only Indian schools but even US colleges with 685 score, they are not putting your application down. No worries about that. Seven O 5, that's a remarkable good score. Anything above 7 100 in GMAT focus is very, very nice. If you push yourself a little bit, get to 715 of all you know, some scholarship opportunities will also open for you. But there are no scholarships for from Indian colleges. You will you will get some scholarship in the in the US colleges if you get to 7715. So yeah, GMAT is the first thing like a good GMAT score can open up a lot of avenues for you for sure. Got it. We'll purchase the course. Yeah, go ahead and we'll come again to you to understand how I can go ahead after that. Absolutely, absolutely. There will be your mentors who would be working for you. But you have my number if you want to, you know, just want to talk about something and get a little more idea. We can always do that. Not an issue. Great. All righty. Yeah. OK. Have a great rest of your day and bye for now. Yeah. Same as well.\n",
      "Prospect:\n",
      "OK, So is that provided by EV MAT or not? So sorry about that. No worries if I if I I mean I believe 700 around would be a score to get around in good institute in India as well as absolutely 685 is the median score for all the colleges across the globe. Very, very nice. So yeah, let's see, I will attend the mock test tomorrow. And yeah, if I get to 685 around and yeah, if 7700 plus, then yeah, I would. Sure. Thank you. Thanks so much for your time, Sumanthir. Thank you so much for. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you.\n"
