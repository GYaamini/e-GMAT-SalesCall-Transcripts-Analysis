# üìä Key Insights

## Conversion Drivers

```bash
‚úî Positive emotions during Q&A & wrap-up phases = higher conversion
‚úî Prospect determination during performance talks = better outcome
‚úî Agent confidence and clarity during explanation & pricing = key
‚úî Balanced speaking ratio, prospect engagement = critical
```

## Findings

```bash
üî∏ Agent-to-Prospect Speaking Ratio: Weak correlation (r = +0.028)
üî∏ Positive Prospect Emotion in Wrap-up: Strong signal of conversions
üî∏ Education Background: CS/Engineering/Postgrad prospects convert more
üî∏ Seasonal Trends: GMAT prep months show conversion spikes
```

## Phase Impact

```bash
üîπ Planning & Product Explanation ‚Üí Clarity driven
üîπ Performance, Q&A & Wrap-Up ‚Üí Engagement & emotion driven
üîπ Pricing Phase ‚Üí Most predictive of outcome
```
