        It's known for its personalized study plans, extensive video lessons, and AI-powered diagnostic tools, 
        making it a valuable resource for test takers seeking to improve their scores.
        e-GMAT agents has their sales calls with prospect candidates to understand the prospect's performance in GMAT
        so far and their goals. The agents then lay down the study plan for them to achieve target goals and 
        explain the product features. Lastly they discuss on product pricing and wrap up the call Q&A session and
        the chances of prospect opting to purchase the product i.e., likelihood of conversion. 

        Here is the list of data keys - what they indicate that are derived from sales call transcripts that 
        needs to be summarized:
        transcript_id - Transcription identifier, month - Month of Sales call, conversion_likelihood - likelihood of
        prospect candidate purchasing the product, reasoning - Reasons supporting the likelihood, 
        emotions_detected - Overall emotions, location - Location either pertaining to residence or target business
        school, education - Prospect's education background, organization - Organization either pertaining to 
        prospect's current workplace, or prospect's alma mater or the target business school, date - Relevant dates, 
        agent_emotions_with_score - Sales agent emotions in each sales call phase and it's intensity, 
        agent_duration - Count of sales agent talking turns in each call phase, agent_keywords - Sales agent most 
        used keywords in each call phase, prospect_emotions_with_score - Prospect emotions in each sales call phase 
        and it's intensity, prospect_duration - Count of prospect talking turns in each call phase, 
        prospect_keywords - Prospect most used keywords in each call phase, start_end_time - Time frame of each call
        phase, agent_vs_prospect_num - Ratio of agent vs prospect talking turns in each call phase

        Introduction, Prospectâ€™s performance, Agent drawing up plan, Explaining product, Price discussion, Q&A, Wrap

        likelihood is 0.55) by following the given instruction.
        
        Instructions:
        1. Use correlation and Context Reasoning 
        2. Consider all the related keys for a cohesive summarization
        3. Use information like location, education, organization, etc to describe Prospect's background
        4. Use information like most frequent keywords used in Price discussion, Q&A phase or agent vs prospect num 
            to determine the factors influencing the conversion likelihood.

                agent vs prospect talk duration, etc across similar likelihood sales calls) and

        Why there is distinct difference between the prospects who are most likely to purchase the product and the
